## Chapter 111 — The Counterfeiting Spirit and the Journey of the Soul

After the disciples poured out their yearning to return to the Light, Jesus continued:

“When you go into cities, nations, or lands, begin by saying this:

‘Search without giving up, until you discover the mysteries of the Light—these are the only way into the Kingdom of Light. Beware of false teachings. Many will come using my name, saying "I am he," but they are not me. They will lead many astray.’

“Now, anyone who comes to you, believes you, listens to your words, and lives in a way that honors the mysteries of the Light—give them the mysteries. Don’t hold them back. Give higher mysteries to those ready for them, and the lower ones to those prepared for those. Don’t hide anything from anyone who is worthy.

But the mystery of raising the dead and healing the sick—do not give this mystery to anyone yet. Don’t even teach it.

That power belongs to the rulers of fate. I’ve given you that mystery so you can demonstrate the truth when people don’t believe. If a city or country rejects you, perform these works—raise the dead, heal the sick—and through these signs, they will recognize that you speak for the true God and will listen to your message. This is why I gave you that mystery—for the sake of establishing the faith throughout the world.”

Then Jesus turned back to Mary and answered a question she had asked earlier:

“Who or what is it that forces a person to sin?”

He explained:

“When a baby is born, its inner power (the divine spark), its soul, and what I call the ‘counterfeiting spirit’—they are all weak, and unaware of good or evil. They're all veiled in deep forgetfulness. The body is also weak.

The child begins to take in the world—its pleasures and delights. And as it does, each part of the self pulls in something:

* The power pulls in divine essence from what is good.
* The soul pulls in what is mixed—good and bad.
* The counterfeiting spirit pulls in the corruptive and lustful elements.
* The body takes in inert matter, not conscious of anything.

Destiny, however, remains untouched by the world—it returns as it came.

Over time, each part grows into its own awareness:

* The power seeks the Light above.
* The soul leans toward righteousness but is conflicted.
* The counterfeiting spirit hungers for evil, sin, and selfish desires.
* The body remains mostly unaware unless animated by material energy.

And as they grow, each part acts according to its nature. Meanwhile, spiritual agents assigned by the rulers record every sin for future judgment.

The counterfeiting spirit is especially dangerous. It pushes the soul toward sin, fulfilling the commands of the dark rulers of fate. It tempts the soul night and day, even in dreams, driving it toward the things of this world. It pretends to be the soul’s own voice, but it is the soul’s enemy.

This spirit is what compels the soul to sin.

**What happens after death**

“When the person’s life ends, fate sends them to death through its agents.

Then, judgment begins. The soul is taken out of the body. For three days, it is taken through the realms of the cosmos. The counterfeiting spirit and destiny follow it. The divine power within returns to the Virgin of Light.

After three days, the soul is taken down into the chaos, the underworld. There, it’s handed over to those who carry out punishment. The counterfeiting spirit stays with the soul, tormenting it and reminding it of the sins it committed. It guides the soul through each punishment, each realm.

Once its punishments in chaos are complete, the spirit leads the soul upward again, to the rulers of the middle realms, who question it. If it lacks the knowledge of the mysteries, they punish it again.

After these trials, the soul is brought before the Virgin of Light. She examines it. If she finds it sinful, she seals it and prepares it for reincarnation. The soul is then cast into a new body, one appropriate to the sins it committed.

And I tell you this: that soul will not be released from the cycle of rebirth until it has completed its last assigned journey and learned its lessons.

I will tell you more about the types of bodies and judgments when I explain the expansion of the universe.”

### What it means

This chapter serves as both a spiritual mission briefing and a cosmic anatomy lesson. Jesus warns his followers to expect resistance and disbelief—and to meet it not with anger, but with demonstration of the mysteries. However, he places a strong boundary around the highest mystery—resurrection and healing—until faith has spread across the world.

Then he pivots into an explanation of the human condition. A person isn’t just one being, but a composite of different parts, each with its own drive:

* The Power longs for the Light.
* The Soul is torn between good and evil.
* The Counterfeiting Spirit pulls toward selfishness and illusion.
* The Body is largely unaware and reactive.

This gives us a vivid, almost mythological map of the inner battle—a spiritual psychology where the soul is constantly being manipulated by a dark force pretending to be itself. This is what makes sin so confusing and pervasive.

After death, Jesus describes a soul’s journey through the underworld, where it is judged not only for its actions but also for its knowledge of the mysteries. The final outcome? Rebirth, matched to the soul’s karmic debt, unless and until the soul has fulfilled its final cycle and can be released.

### Reflection

* What part of yourself feels like it longs for the Light, and what part feels pulled toward distraction or self-indulgence?
* How does the idea of a “counterfeiting spirit” resonate with your experience of inner conflict or temptation?
* What do you think the three-day journey of the soul after death symbolizes in terms of spiritual growth or transformation?
