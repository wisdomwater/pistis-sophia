## Chapter 35 – The Second Repentance: Holding on to the Light

Jesus continued speaking and said: "Pistis Sophia once again lifted her voice in a second repentance, singing these words:

1. Light of all lights, the One in whom I’ve placed my trust—don’t leave me in this darkness until my time is complete.

2. Come to my aid and save me through your sacred mysteries. Hear me and rescue me.

3. Let the power of your Light carry me upward into the higher realms; you are the one who will save and guide me into your divine heights.

4. Save me, O Light, from the grasp of the lion-faced being and the servants of the false god, Self-Willed.

5. It is you, O Light, in whom I’ve always believed—from the beginning, I’ve trusted in your radiance.

6. Even from the moment you brought me forth into being, I’ve had faith in your Light.

7. When I placed my trust in you, the rulers of the realms mocked me, saying, ‘She has lost her mystery.’ But you, O Light, are my savior, my deliverer, and the mystery I seek.

8. My mouth overflows with praise, so I may always speak of your greatness.

9. So please, O Light, do not abandon me in this chaos until the end of my time—do not turn away from me.

10. The forces of Self-Willed have drained me of all my light-power and surrounded me. They are trying to strip me of everything and have set a guard to watch me.

11. They whisper among themselves, ‘The Light has abandoned her—now we can take all that she has.’

12. But I cry out: O Light, do not turn away! Come back and save me from the cruel ones.

13. May those who try to steal my power fall and become weak. May those who seek to take my light be swallowed by darkness and lose their strength."

Jesus said, “This is the second repentance that Pistis Sophia offered, praising the Light.”

### What it means

This second repentance reveals Sophia in a state of deeper struggle, yet stronger faith. She calls out from a place of spiritual exhaustion and isolation, surrounded by forces that drain her light—yet she continues to believe in the Light that gave her life. Her faith is not shaken, even as she suffers.

Symbolically, this speaks to our own inner experience when we feel surrounded by despair, doubt, or external pressures. The "lion-faced power" and "Self-Willed" represent egoic forces—within and without—that seek to keep us trapped in fear, shame, or self-doubt. Sophia’s plea is an act of spiritual endurance: she clings to the truth of the Light even when it seems absent.

Her declaration, “You are my savior, my deliverer, and my mystery,” invites us to see that salvation is not an escape but a transformation. She doesn't ask for revenge but for liberation—for her enemies to fall *into powerlessness*, not to be punished but to lose their grip on her light.

Sophia teaches us how to pray from the depths: not to beg for escape, but to be held and lifted by trust, to remember the divine origin that always remains within us, even when it feels hidden.

### Reflection

* In what areas of your life do you feel surrounded by darkness or drained of energy?
* What would it mean to trust in the Light even when you feel abandoned or mocked by others—or by your own inner voices?
* Can you speak honestly to the Divine about your struggles while still praising the Light that lives within you?
