## Chapter 127 – The Dragon of Outer Darkness and the Severity of Its Chastisements

After Jesus had revealed the details of the outer darkness and its rulers, Mary Magdalene spoke again and asked: “My Lord, will the souls who are sent to that region be assigned to one of the twelve dungeon doors, each according to the judgment it deserves?”

Jesus replied: “No soul is led into the dragon by passing through those doors. Instead, the souls of blasphemers, those who spread false teachings, those who corrupt others, those who are impious, atheists, murderers, adulterers, and sorcerers—if they do not repent while still alive but persist in their sins—these are the ones who are led into the dragon. The same fate awaits souls that have exhausted all their allowed cycles of incarnation and have still not repented.

“At their final incarnation, such souls are drawn into the jaws of the tail of the great dragon of the outer darkness. Once they have entered, the dragon curls its tail into its mouth and traps them inside. That is how they are swallowed into the darkness—not through doors, but through the closing of the serpent's circle.”

Jesus then continued: “This dragon has twelve authentic names—one inscribed above each dungeon door. Though the names differ, they are mysteriously unified. To speak one is to speak all. At the time of the great cosmic unfolding, I will reveal their full meaning. Thus is the dragon of the outer darkness fashioned.”

Mary then asked: “My Lord, are the punishments within that dragon more terrible than all other judgments?”

Jesus answered: “Not only are they more painful, they are far more terrible than all other chastisements. The souls trapped there will be frozen in violent cold, crushed by hail, and burned by raging fire. And at the end of time, when the universe dissolves, they will be annihilated completely, becoming non-existent forever.”

Mary responded in sorrow: “Woe to the souls of the sinners! My Lord, is the fire on earth stronger or the fire in Amente?”

Jesus replied: “Truly, I tell you:
- The fire in Amente is nine times stronger than the fire on earth.
- The fire in the great chaos is nine times stronger than that of Amente.
- The fire in the chastisements of the rulers of the Midst is nine times stronger than the fire of the great chaos.
- And the fire in the dragon of the outer darkness and all its punishments is seventy times stronger than the fire of all the rulers' judgments combined.”

### What it means

This chapter paints a chilling vision of spiritual consequence. The dragon of the outer darkness is not merely symbolic of punishment—it is a spiritual structure where souls that persistently reject repentance and Light are drawn and sealed. The repetition of ninefold intensity reflects ascending degrees of suffering, culminating in the unimaginable seventyfold torment of the dragon’s realm.

But beneath the horror lies a warning born of compassion: this fate is not assigned at random. It is the final result of choices made in resistance to the Light. The text also suggests that time, rebirth, and divine patience offer many chances to repent. Yet those who presume upon endless time—those who abuse grace—may find themselves shut out when the gates of Light are closed.

The mystery of the twelve names reflects the complexity and unity of divine judgment. It also underscores how spiritual reality is layered, ordered, and governed, even in its most fearsome dimensions.

### Reflection

* Do you ever put off spiritual transformation, assuming you’ll deal with it “later”? What would it mean to truly heed the call now?
* The imagery here is terrifying—how do you respond emotionally or spiritually to this portrayal of divine judgment?
* What might it look like to live in such a way that you are always turning toward the Light, without waiting for a “final chance”?
