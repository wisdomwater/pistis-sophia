## Chapter 80 – The Reversal of Injustice

Martha came forward and said, “My Lord, I am clear in spirit and understand the meaning of these words. Please allow me to share their interpretation openly.”

The First Mystery replied, “I give you permission, Martha. Go ahead and explain the meaning of the words that Pistis Sophia has sung.”

Martha said, “My Lord, these words were prophesied long ago by your light-power through David in the seventh Psalm:

12. God is a just judge—strong, patient, and slow to pour out wrath.

13. But if people do not turn back from their ways, He will sharpen His sword. He has bent His bow and made it ready.

14. He has prepared tools of justice—His arrows are meant for those consumed by destructive fire.

15. Look—wrongdoing is like a pregnancy: injustice is conceived and gives birth to evil.

16. Those who dig a trap for others will fall into the very hole they made.

17. Their own wickedness will come crashing down on them, and the harm they planned will return to their own heads.”

When Martha finished speaking, the First Mystery who watches from outside the world said to her, “Well spoken, beautifully done, Martha, blessed one.”

### What it means

Martha’s interpretation of Sophia’s plea is a reaffirmation of the spiritual law of return—what one sows, one reaps. In this chapter, we are reminded that even though evil seems to thrive for a time, divine justice is always at work beneath the surface. It is not hasty or reactionary, but slow, deliberate, and perfectly timed.

The human psyche often wrestles with injustice—not just in the world, but within our own hearts. We may carry bitterness, envy, or a thirst for control. Sometimes we dig pits for others—judgments, manipulation, resentment—only to fall into them ourselves. The dark forces Sophia faces are not only external entities but also reflections of inner corruption, confusion, and woundedness that fester when unhealed.

But here’s the grace: God, the Light, is long-suffering. That means the Light gives time and space for repentance, for awakening, for turning around. Yet if we persist in clinging to darkness, the very structures we build to trap others will collapse on us. Not because God is cruel—but because the universe is just, and wholeness will not be mocked.

Martha's clear, sober insight shows us that true understanding doesn’t come from intellect alone, but from purity of spirit. She sees that Sophia’s song is not only a cry of pain, but also a declaration of faith in divine law—that nothing truly good will be lost, and nothing truly evil will last.

### Reflection

* Are there any “pits” you may have dug—through judgment, resentment, or fear—that you now find yourself falling into?
* What would it mean to trust that divine justice works even when you can't see immediate results?
* How might you cultivate the clarity and sobriety of spirit that Martha displays?
