## Chapter 8 — “The Divine Birth and the Secret in You”

Jesus continued:

**“After these things, following the command of the First Mystery, I looked down again upon the human world. I found Mary—called my mother in terms of the material world—and I spoke to her in the form of the angel Gabriel.”**

**“When she turned toward me, opening herself to the higher realms, I sent into her the first divine power I had received from Barbēlō. This became the body I would wear from the heights. And instead of an ordinary soul, I gave her a sacred power from the great Sabaōth, the Good One, who dwells in the region of the Right.”**

Jesus then spoke again about the twelve disciples:

**“The twelve divine powers I received from the twelve saviors in the Treasury of Light—I cast those into the sphere ruled by the lower powers. The rulers and their agents mistook these powers for their own creations and sent them into the world, placing them into your mothers’ wombs.”**

**“That’s how you came into this world: not with souls crafted by the rulers of fate, but with powers of divine origin. You carry the essence of the Helper—the one who infused light into the world of Mixture, where destruction and creation are blended.”**

**“This light, from the very beginning, came from me. I gave it to the First Commandment, which passed it to the great Light. The great Light passed part of it to five divine Helpers. The last of these Helpers breathed it into the Mixture—into all things in this world, blending it with all beings, visible and invisible, mortal and eternal.”**

Jesus then turned to his disciples on the Mount of Olives and said:

**“Rejoice—truly rejoice! The time has come for me to put on my Vesture of Light, the radiant form prepared for me since the beginning. I left it behind in the highest mystery until now—until this moment of fulfillment.”**

**“Now I have been commanded by the First Mystery to reveal the full truth to you, from its innermost depths to its most outward expression. Through you, the world will be saved. So rejoice—you are more blessed than any others on earth. You are the ones through whom the world will awaken.”**

### What it means

This chapter expands on the divine incarnation of Jesus—not as a supernatural act to glorify his body, but as a carefully orchestrated event of sacred transmission. Mary is chosen not just as a womb, but as one who turns toward the Light, ready to receive a divine essence.

Jesus’s body is not from the ordinary world, nor is his soul shaped by the rulers of fate. He enters with a divine configuration—his body infused with power from Barbēlō (a symbol of divine thought or will), and his soul from Sabaōth, the Good (a purified spiritual force on the right-hand path).

And this isn’t just about *him*. It’s about *us*.

The disciples—and symbolically, all true seekers—have received divine power that even the archonic rulers mistake as their own. This means that even in a world of chaos and forgetfulness (“the Mixture”), there is a hidden light in us. That light, passed through many layers of divine intention, lives within.

The “Vesture of Light” represents spiritual readiness and fullness. Jesus putting it on means he is fully prepared to reveal truth not just in part, but completely—from the innermost mysteries to the most external teachings.

And the best part? He tells the disciples that the world will be saved *through them*. The divine work is not finished *for* us—it is to be completed *through* us.

### Reflection

1. What does it mean to you that the world of matter is a “mixture”—a blend of divine and destructive forces?
2. Have you ever felt like something powerful and eternal lives in you, even when life’s rulers or systems tried to define you otherwise?
3. What would it look like for you to “put on your Vesture of Light”? What parts of you are ready to shine more fully?
