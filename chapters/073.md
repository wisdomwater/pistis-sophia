## Chapter 73 – Sophia Gives Thanks; Martha Interprets

After Mary interpreted Sophia’s last song, the First Mystery responded warmly:

“Well said, beautifully done, Mary—blessed one.”

Then he continued, saying:

**Sophia’s Song Continues**  

1. “The Light has become my savior.  

2. It has turned my darkness into light. It has torn through the chaos that surrounded me and clothed me in light.”

After these words, Martha stepped forward and said:

“My Lord, your power prophesied long ago through David (from *Psalm 29*):

10. ‘The Lord has become my helper.  

11. He has turned my mourning into joy; he has torn off my mourning garments and clothed me in gladness.’”

When the First Mystery heard this, he said:

“Well said, and beautifully spoken, Martha.”

He continued, sharing more of Sophia’s song:

**Sophia’s Praise Continues**  

1. “My power, sing praises to the Light, and never forget all the gifts the Light has given you.  

2. Let all the powers within you sing to the name of his holy Mystery.  

3. He forgives all your transgressions and saves you from every affliction the emanations of Self-Willed brought upon you.  

4. He has rescued your light from the destructive powers of Self-Willed. In his compassion, he surrounded you with light and saved you.  

5. He has filled you with purified light, and your beginning will renew itself as an invisible one of the Height.”

The First Mystery concluded:

“These are the words with which Pistis Sophia sang, giving thanks for her salvation, remembering everything I had done for her.”

### What it means

This chapter continues Sophia’s joyful transformation. No longer trapped or pleading, she is now fully in the light. Her song is radiant with gratitude. She has not only been saved *from* darkness but filled *with* divine light, purified, and made new.

Martha joins in this sacred moment, echoing Sophia’s experience through a passage from Psalm 29. The parallel is strong: just as the Psalmist’s mourning is turned to joy, so too has Sophia been clothed not in chaos, but in light.

Sophia’s praise is deeply personal and also universal. She calls not just her voice but *all the powers within her* to praise the Light. This isn’t just a song of thankfulness—it’s a restoration of her identity, a reintegration of all her parts into harmony with the Divine.

There’s also a striking phrase here:

*“Your beginning will renew itself as an invisible of the Height.”*

This suggests a return to original purity—a rebirth not just in body or soul, but in eternal essence. Sophia is now becoming one with the unseen, eternal world above—no longer broken, but wholly renewed.

### Reflection

* What chaos in your life is being “torn through” so that light can reach you?
* Are there parts of yourself that long to sing praises, but you’ve forgotten what the Light has done for you?
* How might you allow your “beginning to renew itself”—not by going back, but by being reborn in the present?
