## Chapter 18 — Summary and Reflection

Mary Magdalene speaks to Jesus: “My Lord, when you said, ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear,’ you meant for us to understand your message clearly. Please listen as I speak openly.”

She then explains the meaning of Jesus’ words through the prophecy of Isaiah. Mary says that Isaiah foretold how Jesus would take away a third of the power from the rulers of all the æons (spiritual realms) and change their fate and spheres. This was done so that the rulers and their astrologers, who taught humans sorcery and evil deeds, would no longer be able to influence or predict the future. Jesus altered their spheres so they spend half the year turned left, half turned right, thus weakening their power.

Mary continues, quoting Isaiah’s prophecy about “Egypt,” which symbolizes these rulers as bound to matter and ignorance. Isaiah said they would no longer know the plans of the Lord Sabaōth (a divine authority), meaning they would lose control over fate and destiny.

Because Jesus has the light-power from Sabaōth within him—within his earthly body—he can change these powers. This is why Jesus said, “Who has ears to hear, let him hear,” to reveal who truly seeks the kingdom of heaven with a devoted heart.

**What it means:**
This chapter reveals how Jesus’ spiritual authority undermines the powers of fate and sorcery that control the material world. Mary Magdalene helps interpret this mystical teaching by connecting it to Isaiah’s prophecy. The rulers symbolized as “Egypt” represent forces of material bondage and ignorance. Jesus’ victory over them opens the way for those with sincere hearts to rise toward spiritual freedom.

**Reflection questions:**

* What do the “rulers of the æons” symbolize in your own understanding?
* How do you see the relationship between spiritual light and material fate?
* In what ways do you feel called to have “ears to hear” the deeper truths in your life?
