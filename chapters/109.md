## Chapter 109 — Mysteries That Deliver the Soul from Suffering and Death

Mary continued to question Jesus and said:

“Lord, didn’t you bring the sacred mysteries into the world so that people don’t have to die in horrible ways—like being killed by the sword, drowning, torture, or other violent deaths caused by the powers of fate?

Didn’t you bring the mysteries so we could die peacefully, without suffering—especially because so many people persecute us because of you? They torture us hoping we’ll give away the sacred mysteries. So wouldn’t it be better if we could simply speak the mystery and leave our bodies instantly, without pain?”

Then Jesus said to all his disciples:

“Yes, I have already spoken about this, but I will say it again so you understand clearly:

Whoever truly completes the first mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable—whoever performs it with all its forms, figures, and steps—will not be trapped in their body like others.

After completing it, whenever they speak the name of that mystery, they will be protected from whatever death or suffering is destined for them by the powers of fate. In that moment, they can leave their body peacefully.

Their soul will become like a stream of radiant light, rising upward through all the realms of the rulers and beyond into the realms of the Light, until it reaches its true home in the Kingdom.

That soul will not need to defend itself, answer questions, or present tokens or signs in any realm—it will pass through freely, because it belongs to the Light.”

### What it means

This chapter addresses a raw and real question from Mary: Can the mysteries protect us from the brutal deaths assigned by fate or persecution?

It’s a cry from someone watching her friends face violence, knowing they’re being hunted because of their devotion to Christ and the Light. Mary longs for a way to escape the agony of death—to simply release the soul in peace.

Jesus responds with a profound teaching: yes, the sacred mysteries—especially the first mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable—have the power to liberate the soul from suffering. This mystery is not just a ritual—it’s a spiritual transformation that allows the soul to rise, unbound by the laws of fate or violence.

Once the mystery is fully lived and embodied, merely invoking its name is enough. The soul instantly becomes light, ascends, and passes through all realms without resistance or judgment. It is no longer subject to the powers that rule over death and karma.

This is radical: it implies that the inner transformation brought about by the mystery is stronger than destiny—stronger than persecution, suffering, or even the natural laws of life and death.

This teaching gives comfort to those who suffer for their faith or are caught in the machinery of this world. It reminds us that the deepest mysteries of the Divine can free us not just after death, but even from the experience of suffering during death.
