## Chapter 142 – The Sacred Rite of Forgiveness

Jesus said to his disciples, “Bring me fire and vine branches.” They did so. He then prepared a sacred offering. He placed two wine vessels—one on the right, one on the left. In front of the vessel on the right, he placed a cup of water. In front of the vessel on the left, he placed a cup of wine. Between the two, he laid loaves of bread—one for each disciple—and behind the loaves, he placed another cup of water.

Jesus stood before the offering, and the disciples stood behind him, all clothed in linen garments. In their hands they held the cipher—the spiritual symbol—of the name of the Father from the Treasury of the Light.

Then Jesus prayed:

“Listen to me, Father of all fathers, Light beyond all limits:

I call on you, O Forgiver of sins, Purifier of hearts. Forgive the sins of these disciples who have followed me and obeyed my words. Make them worthy to enter the Kingdom of my Father,  
the one who is from the Treasury of the Light.  

Let the powers of forgiveness come near—by their sacred name — and blot out all iniquity from these souls. They have sinned knowingly and unknowingly, they have fallen in passion, in adultery, in error. Forgive them, and make them worthy to receive this sacred offering.”

Then Jesus said, “Father, if you have heard me and forgiven these souls, show me a sign in this offering.”

And the sign appeared.

Jesus turned to his disciples and said, “Rejoice! Your sins are forgiven, your guilt erased, and you are counted as part of the Kingdom of my Father.”

The disciples were filled with joy.

Jesus continued: “This is the rite—the sacred mystery—you are to perform for all those who have faith in you, who live in sincerity, and who listen to the truth you speak. When you do this for them, their sins will be forgiven—up to the day of this offering.

But keep this rite sacred. Do not share it with just anyone, but only with those who follow the path I have shown you.

This is the baptism of the first offering. It reveals the way to the region of Truth and the region of Light.”

### What it means

This chapter introduces a powerful and intimate ritual—a mystical Eucharist of forgiveness and transformation. It echoes and deepens the Christian sacraments we may recognize: bread, wine, water, fire. But here, each element becomes a conscious invocation of divine energies.

Jesus doesn’t simply perform a ritual; he calls forth the presence of the Father, Light, and Forgiveness. He connects the outer symbols to inner truths: the soul’s purification, the erasing of guilt, and the realignment with the Divine.

The mystery is not meant for everyone—only those who sincerely walk the path. Why? Because such sacred rituals require openness, sincerity, and readiness. Forgiveness is not magic; it is transformation. And this transformation is both inward and cosmic. Even the elements—fire and water—are drawn from the divine realms of Light and Barbēlō, showing us that all things, even the physical, participate in spiritual renewal.

The rite is not just a performance. It’s a gateway. A baptism into Truth. A way to rejoin the Light we came from.

### Reflection

* What sacred rituals or practices help you reconnect to the Light and truth of your soul?
* How do you approach forgiveness—as something granted, something earned, or something embodied?
* In what ways might you prepare yourself to receive or offer sacred healing to others?
