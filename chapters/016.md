## Chapter 16 — “The Order of the Heavens is Changed”

Jesus said:

“When I entered the realm of the rebellious powers, they **rose up against the Light** and tried to resist me.

So I **took away a third of their power**, so they could no longer carry out their harmful actions.

And I **changed the pattern** of the cosmic forces—the **Fate and the sphere** over which these powers ruled.

Now, I have set them to **move to the left** for six months, during which they carry out their influences. Then I turn them to **the right** for six months, where they continue their influence in a different way.”

### What it means

This chapter is a **brief restatement and reinforcement** of what was shared in Chapter 15. It emphasizes that **when the rebellious powers tried to resist the Light**, Jesus didn’t destroy them—but **transformed their influence**.

By taking away part of their power and **rebalancing their movement**, he brings **harmony** to what was once oppressive and one-sided.

The shift between left and right—often symbolizing **judgment and mercy**, **fate and freedom**, or **yin and yang**—implies that creation now breathes in **cycles of influence** instead of being trapped in a fixed, rigid flow.

It’s a message of **divine recalibration**: rather than wiping out what resists, the Light **integrates it back into order**.

### Reflection

1. **How do you react when inner resistance or fear rises against clarity or truth?**
2. **Is there a pattern in your life that’s been too one-sided? What would it look like to bring balance—another “direction”—into it?**
3. **In what ways do you try to control the flow of life, rather than letting it move through natural rhythms of left and right, giving and receiving, rest and action?**
4. **How can you embrace transformation—not by force—but by reordering the influences that shape your inner world?**
