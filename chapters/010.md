## Chapter 10 — The Mystery of the Vesture of Light

At sunrise, a powerful divine light descended. Within that light was Jesus’ *Vesture*—the radiant spiritual garment he had left behind in the 24th Mystery.

Jesus said:

“In this Vesture, I discovered a mystery written in five sacred words from the heights:
*zama zama ōzza rachama ōzai.*

The meaning of these words is this:

‘O Mystery, dwelling beyond the world, the One for whom the entire universe came into being—
you are the source of every emanation, every being, every realm, and every hidden truth.
Come to us, for we are of you. We are all one and the same with you.
You are the First Mystery, existing in the Ineffable even before you were revealed.
Now we all come to meet you at the edge of time and space—
for even this final boundary is part of you.
We now return to you the Vesture that has always been yours,
which you left behind until the right moment had come.
That moment is now. Put it on.’”

### The Three Vestures of Light

Then came a divine message:

“Come to us, so we may clothe you in the full glory of the First Mystery.
By its command, we give you not just one, but three sacred vestures—because you are worthy,
for you existed before us all.”

1. The First Vesture holds the glory and names of all mysteries and emanations that come from the Ineffable—the unnamable source beyond all things.

2. The Second Vesture contains the glory of all names and mysteries within the two realms of the First Mystery.

3. The Third Vesture, just now returned to Jesus, holds:

* The mystery of the Revealer (the First Commandment),
* The five Impressions and five Helpers,
* The great Envoy of the Ineffable (the divine light),
* All the saviors of the Treasury of Light,
* The Seven Amēns, the Seven Voices, the Five Trees, and the Three Amēns,
* The Twin Savior, the Child of the Child,
* The nine guardians of the gates of the Treasury of Light,
* And all the divine beings from the Right, the Midst, and the Thirteenth Aeon,
* Including the twelve Aeons, their rulers, archangels, and angels, and all within Fate, the heavens, the sphere, and its firmaments.

“This Vesture’s full glory was hidden. None in the universe—from the First Commandment downward—knew it.
Now it has been revealed. Put it on. Come to us quickly, so we may clothe you in the remaining two garments.
Then you will fulfill your divine purpose and return in full glory—
the glory of the First Mystery.”

### What it means

This chapter is a revelation of spiritual identity. The Vesture is not just a garment—it is Jesus’ full divine essence, his eternal glory hidden while he fulfilled his mission in the material world. The moment of reclaiming the Vesture is the moment of reuniting with his divine origin.

The five sacred words—*zama zama ōzza rachama ōzai*—act like a cosmic mantra or soul-key. They represent a deep calling from the soul back to its true home. The words themselves defy literal translation, which is part of their power; they are meant to awaken a resonance in the heart, not just the mind. They express a recognition: we come from the Mystery, we are of it, and now we return.

The three Vestures represent different dimensions of divine reality. The First Vesture holds the mysteries that come from the Infinite itself—the uncreated source. This is like the part of the soul that remembers its divine origin, untouched by the world.

The Second Vesture holds the secrets and names within the First Mystery—this suggests the inner structure of divine intention and sacred order. It's where being becomes purpose, where divine knowing becomes divine doing.

The Third Vesture contains the Revealer’s mission—every power, helper, and divine aspect that brings salvation, healing, and awakening. It's the map of redemption. It includes layers of being from the highest angelic forms to the guardians of the gates of Light. In reclaiming it, Jesus becomes the embodied bridge between heaven and earth, the soul fully awakened and fully radiant.

All these elements—the First Commandment, the Five Trees, the Twin Savior, and others—symbolize spiritual truths at play within us. The Five Helpers may represent faculties like wisdom, strength, compassion, clarity, and will. The Seven Amēns and Seven Voices point to sacred harmonies that heal and restore. The Three Amēns might reflect the triune flow of divine power—creation, sustenance, return.

The hidden glory of the Vesture speaks to a truth many of us feel: that who we really are has been veiled, waiting for a moment of remembrance. That moment, for Jesus, is now. For us, it may come in quiet transformation, crisis, or grace.

The invitation is to remember: your own light has not been lost. It has been held in waiting until you are ready to wear it again.

### Reflection

* Which part of this vision resonates with you most—the return to divine origin, the sense of being one with the First Mystery, or the Vestures of Light?
* Do you believe your own spiritual journey is also a return to something that has always belonged to you, waiting until the right time?
* What would it mean for you to “put on your Vesture”—to fully embody your divine nature in the world?
