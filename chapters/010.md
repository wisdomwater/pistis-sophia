## Chapter 10 — The Mystery of the Vesture of Light

At sunrise, a powerful divine light descended. Within that light was Jesus’ *Vesture*—the radiant spiritual garment he had left behind in the 24th Mystery.

Jesus said:

“In this Vesture, I discovered a mystery written in five sacred words from the heights:
***zama zama ōzza rachama ōzai.***

The meaning of these words is this:

‘O Mystery, dwelling beyond the world, the One for whom the entire universe came into being—
you are the source of every emanation, every being, every realm, and every hidden truth.
Come to us, for we are of you. We are all one and the same with you.
You are the First Mystery, existing in the Ineffable even before you were revealed.
Now we all come to meet you at the edge of time and space—
for even this final boundary is part of you.
We now return to you the Vesture that has always been yours,
which you left behind until the right moment had come.
That moment is now. Put it on.’”

### The Three Vestures of Light

Then came a divine message:

“Come to us, so we may clothe you in the full glory of the First Mystery.
By its command, we give you not just one, but three sacred vestures—because you are worthy,
for you existed before us all.”

1. The First Vesture holds the glory and names of all mysteries and emanations that come from the Ineffable—the unnamable source beyond all things.

2. The Second Vesture contains the glory of all names and mysteries within the two realms of the First Mystery.

3. The Third Vesture, just now returned to Jesus, holds:

* The mystery of the Revealer (the First Commandment),
* The five Impressions and five Helpers,
* The great Envoy of the Ineffable (the divine light),
* All the saviors of the Treasury of Light,
* The Seven Amēns, the Seven Voices, the Five Trees, and the Three Amēns,
* The Twin Savior, the Child of the Child,
* The nine guardians of the gates of the Treasury of Light,
* And all the divine beings from the Right, the Midst, and the Thirteenth Aeon,
* Including the twelve Aeons, their rulers, archangels, and angels, and all within Fate, the heavens, the sphere, and its firmaments.

“This Vesture’s full glory was hidden. None in the universe—from the First Commandment downward—knew it.
Now it has been revealed. Put it on. Come to us quickly, so we may clothe you in the remaining two garments.
Then you will fulfill your divine purpose and return in full glory—
the glory of the First Mystery.”

### What it means

This chapter is rich with symbolic and mystical imagery. The *Vesture* represents divine identity and authority—the radiant truth of Jesus' being. In putting it on, Jesus reclaims his full glory and is recognized by the heavenly realms as the one who existed before all creation.

The *five sacred words* are like a cosmic password, a song from beyond the universe, calling the divine soul back to its origin. They acknowledge unity with the source, expressing that all beings of Light are parts of the same whole.

The *three Vestures* reflect three layers of divine reality:

* The Unknowable Source (Ineffable),
* The First Mystery (the beginning of divine emanation),
* And the Revealer (Christ-consciousness active in the world).

Receiving these Vestures isn’t just about clothing—it's about being acknowledged, empowered, and reconnected with divine origin and purpose.

### Reflection

* Which part of this vision resonates with you most—the return to divine origin, the sense of being one with the First Mystery, or the Vestures of Light?
* Do you believe your own spiritual journey is also a return to something that has always belonged to you, waiting until the right time?
* What would it mean for you to “put on your Vesture”—to fully embody your divine nature in the world?
