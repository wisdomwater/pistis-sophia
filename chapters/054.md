## Chapter 54 – The Rise and Fall of Pride

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples:

“When the lion-faced power saw me approaching Pistis Sophia—shining with overwhelming brilliance—it grew even more enraged. It released from itself a multitude of vicious forces, trying once more to dominate her. In the face of this renewed assault, Sophia spoke her eleventh repentance:

1. Why has this mighty power risen up in evil?  

2. Its schemes steal my light again and again; like sharp iron, they strip my power.  

3. I chose to descend into chaos rather than stay in the thirteenth æon, the place of Righteousness.  

4. They tried to trick me in order to drain me completely.  

5. Because of this, the Light will strip them of all their light and reduce their matter to nothing. They will be cast out of the thirteenth æon and no longer be counted among the living.  

6. The twenty-four emanations will witness your fall, lion-faced power, and fear. They will not rebel, but instead purify their light.  

7. They will rejoice and say: Look—a power that refused to purify itself and instead gloried in its strength, seeking to steal Sophia’s light. Now, its light is taken away.

Then Jesus invited someone to step forward and interpret this repentance.

Salome came forward and said:

“Lord, your light-power once spoke through David in Psalm 51, which mirrors Sophia’s words:

1. Why does the powerful one boast in wickedness?  

2. Your tongue plots injustice all day long; like a sharp razor, you deal in deceit.  

3. You love evil more than good, lies more than truth.  

4. You love every destructive word, O deceitful tongue.  

5. Therefore, God will tear you down, uproot you, and cast you out from the dwelling of the living.  

6. The righteous will see this and be in awe, and they’ll mock you:  

7. ‘Here is the one who didn’t trust God, but his wealth and vanity!’  

8. But I am like a fruitful olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s eternal grace.  

9. I give thanks because you are faithful; I will wait on your name, for it is good among the holy ones.”

Salome concluded, “This, my Lord, is the meaning of the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Your light awakened me, and I have spoken it as you desired.”

Jesus praised her: “Well said, Salome. Truly, I tell you, I will complete you in all the mysteries of the Kingdom of the Light.”

### What it means

This chapter confronts the destructive nature of pride and deception, especially when cloaked in false light. The lion-faced power represents a force that pretends to shine but seeks only to consume. Sophia’s refusal to give in, even in chaos, shows her growing strength and clarity. She no longer just pleads for rescue—she speaks with prophetic vision and judgment, naming the justice that will come.

Her words also suggest that her suffering serves a purpose: to awaken others (the 24 emanations) to purify themselves. Even her oppressor becomes a cautionary tale that inspires transformation in others.

Salome’s interpretation brings this into the human heart. Like the Psalmist, she names how the wicked trust in their own strength and lies, but that the faithful find their roots in the grace of the Divine. Her voice, rarely highlighted in scripture, is honored here—and Jesus promises her full initiation into the mysteries.

### Reflection

* Have you ever encountered a “false light”—something that looked good on the surface but drained your spirit?
* How do you respond when confronted with forces that try to diminish or deceive you?
* In what ways might your struggles serve as a mirror or a warning to others?
