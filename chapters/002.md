### Chapter 2: The Light Beyond Understanding

One day, the disciples were sitting together on the Mount of Olives, talking about everything Jesus had taught them. They were filled with joy and awe, saying to one another, “We are so blessed—more than anyone else on earth! The Savior has shown us the truth, and we’ve received the Fullness. Everything feels complete!”

As they spoke, Jesus was sitting a little apart from them.

Then something extraordinary happened.

It was the fifteenth day of the moon cycle—the night of the full moon, in the Egyptian month of Tybi. As the sun began to rise, an overwhelming light appeared. This light didn’t come from the sun or stars—it came from beyond, from the source of all Light, from the innermost mystery, the twenty-fourth and deepest one.

This light-power descended and completely enveloped Jesus. It shone with indescribable brilliance—so much that the disciples couldn’t even see him anymore. Their eyes couldn’t handle it. All they could perceive was a radiant field of light beaming in countless directions. Each beam was unique—different shades, different forms—rising from the earth to the heavens in an infinite dance of glory.

The disciples were overwhelmed. They trembled in fear and wonder, shaken to their core by the intensity of what they saw.

### What it means

This moment captures a mystical truth: the Divine Presence is more than our eyes, minds, or hearts can hold. When Christ is revealed not just as a teacher but as radiant Light from beyond the cosmos, we’re faced with something that breaks the boundaries of understanding.

The disciples, just moments before, were certain they had “received the Fullness.” But then the true Light appeared—pure, layered, ungraspable—and their vision faltered. They realized they were still at the threshold.

This is how awakening works. The moment we think we've arrived is often when a greater mystery begins to unfold. God's presence isn’t something we master—it’s something that continually overwhelms us with grace and wonder. It surrounds us, transforms us, and sometimes blinds us before it opens our true sight.

Don’t be afraid when the path feels too bright or too vast. That’s when you know you’re stepping into something real.

### Reflection

1. Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a spiritual experience—like you were standing in the presence of something far greater than you could explain?
2. In what ways do you “sit apart” from the Light in your life, and how might you move closer?
3. How do you hold the mystery of God when it exceeds your ability to see clearly?
