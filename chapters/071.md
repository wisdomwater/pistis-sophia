## Chapter 71 – Matthew Interprets Sophia’s Second Song

After the First Mystery finished speaking, Matthew stepped forward and said:

“I have understood the meaning of the song Pistis Sophia sang. Please, give me permission to share it.”

The First Mystery replied, “I give you permission, Matthew, to speak the interpretation.”

Then Matthew said:

“The meaning of Sophia’s song was already prophesied through the *Odes of Solomon*, where your divine light spoke through the words:

1. He who led me down from the high regions above also led me back up from the depths below.

2. He who encountered those in the middle taught me about them.

3. He who scattered my enemies gave me power to break their bonds.

4. He struck the seven-headed serpent with my hands and lifted me above its root, so I could extinguish its seed.

5. You were with me, helping me; your name surrounded me in every place.

6. Your right hand destroyed the poison of the slanderer; you cleared the path for your faithful ones.

7. You freed them from the tombs and lifted them from the corpses.

8. You took dead bones and gave them bodies; you gave life to those who were motionless.

9. Your way became indestructible—and so did your face.

10. You raised your realm above decay, so all things could be released and renewed, and your light could be their foundation.

11. You poured your riches upon them, and they became a holy dwelling-place.”

Matthew continued:

“This is the true meaning of the song Sophia sang.

When Solomon wrote: *‘He who led me down from above also led me up from below,’* it corresponds to Sophia’s words: *‘Through your command I was led down from the higher aeon, and you led me up again from the regions below.’*

When Solomon said: *‘He took those in the middle and taught me,’* it matches Sophia’s: *‘You purified the matter in the midst of my power, and I saw it.’*

*‘He scattered my foes’* corresponds to: *‘You scattered the emanations of Self-Willed that oppressed me.’*

*‘He gave me power to unloose the bonds’* mirrors: *‘You gave me wisdom to free myself from their bonds.’*

*‘He struck the seven-headed serpent with my hands’* is the same as: *‘You struck the basilisk through my hands and destroyed its seed.’*

*‘You were with me, helping me’* reflects: *‘You gave me power and were always with me.’*

*‘Your name surrounded me’* equals: *‘Your light surrounded me in every place.’*

*‘Your right hand destroyed the venom of slanderers’* reflects: *‘You took away their power by removing the light from them.’*

*‘Your hand cleared the way for the faithful’* echoes: *‘You made straight my path out of chaos, because I trusted you.’*

*‘You freed them from tombs and corpses’* aligns with: *‘You delivered me from chaos and the material darkness where my powers had lost their light.’*

*‘You gave dead bones new bodies and life’* reflects: *‘You filled all the parts of me that had no light with pure light from above.’*

*‘Your way and face became indestructible’* matches: *‘Your way was made straight for me, and your face became my eternal life.’*

*‘You led your realm above decay to renew all things’* is like: *‘You raised me above the chaos, so all things could be released and renewed in your light.’*

*‘Your light became their foundation’* equals: *‘Your light is now in all my powers.’*

Finally, *‘You poured your riches and made him a holy dwelling’* matches: *‘You poured your stream of light into me, and I became pure light.’*

This, my Lord, is the true interpretation of Sophia’s second song.”

### What it means

In this chapter, Matthew interprets Sophia’s song through the *Odes of Solomon*, an early Christian mystical hymn. He draws line-by-line parallels between Sophia’s praise and the words of the ancient ode. This is more than a literary exercise—it’s a declaration that Sophia’s personal spiritual journey is a universal one, already woven into sacred tradition.

Each verse speaks of restoration, liberation, and transformation. Powers once dormant are awakened. Chaos is overcome. Dead bones receive life. The seven-headed serpent (a symbol of overwhelming fear, deception, or ego) is crushed—not by force alone, but by divine partnership.

The repeating theme is that of *return and renewal*. The soul descends, faces fragmentation, and is restored by Divine Light—not as it was before, but stronger, wiser, full of new life.

Importantly, Sophia isn’t just rescued. She participates. The serpent is destroyed *through her hands*. She is not merely a passive recipient of grace; she is a co-creator in her own redemption.

Matthew’s interpretation reaffirms that the divine blueprint of redemption has always been present. Sophia’s song echoes through sacred texts and timeless truths. Her journey becomes a mirror for our own.

### Reflection

* What parts of your life story echo ancient patterns of descent, struggle, and renewal?
* How does the image of Sophia *actively* partnering in her liberation resonate with your own experience?
* Can you identify moments when the Light made your “dead bones” live again—when something in you came alive that you thought was lost?
