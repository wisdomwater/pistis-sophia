## Chapter 3 — When Heaven Trembles

As the radiant light surrounded Jesus completely, he began to rise—slowly ascending into the heights, shining more brilliantly than anything the disciples had ever seen. The light was immeasurable, overwhelming. The disciples watched silently, eyes fixed on him as he rose, no one daring to speak, until he vanished into heaven.

This happened on the fifteenth day of the lunar month of Tybi, when the moon was full.

Three hours after Jesus had entered the heavens, everything—above and below—was shaken. The powers of heaven were thrown into confusion. They clashed and stirred in their realms, and the energies of all the aeons and their orders were disrupted. Even the earth trembled, and all living beings felt it. Fear and confusion spread throughout the world. The disciples, too, were shaken. Everyone wondered, “Is this the end of the world?”

The unrest in the heavens and on earth didn’t stop. The entire cosmic order was in motion—powers struggling, energies colliding—from the third hour of that day until the ninth hour of the next.

Yet even in the midst of this cosmic trembling, all the angels and archangels and the great powers of the heights began to sing. Their praises rose up toward the innermost places of Light, echoing throughout creation. Their voices did not stop, and their praises could be heard by the whole world until the ninth hour of the next day.

### What it means

This chapter shows us how real transformation often feels like disruption. When Jesus ascends, it isn’t a quiet moment of peace—it sets off a cosmic upheaval. The heavens shake, the earth trembles, and all beings are thrown into uncertainty. Even the disciples are afraid. But through the chaos, a hidden truth unfolds: the soul’s ascent disturbs the old order.

When divine light enters a new space—especially the higher realms—it forces everything to rearrange. This mirrors our inner journey. When we begin to awaken spiritually, we might expect peace and clarity, but what often comes first is disorientation. Old patterns resist. Structures shake. And parts of us fear the world is ending.

But in the background of the shaking, there is song. The powers of light are praising the innermost Light—because they know what we may forget: this trembling is not destruction, but re-creation. The chaos is birth.

Your personal “earthquakes”—emotional, psychological, or spiritual—might feel like loss or instability. But they can also be signs that something luminous is breaking through. The soul is being re-ordered around a deeper center.

### Reflection

1. Have you ever experienced a time of upheaval that later revealed itself as a turning point in your growth?
2. What parts of your life or identity feel “shaken” when you get closer to your deeper truth?
3. Can you begin to listen for the song of praise that might be sounding beneath the noise of your transformation?
