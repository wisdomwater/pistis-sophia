## Chapter 9 — “The Vesture of Light and the Promise of Fullness”

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, he continued:

**“Look—I have now put on my Vesture of Light, and I’ve been given full authority by the First Mystery.”**

**“Soon I will reveal to you the mystery of the universe—the whole of it—and nothing will be hidden from you any longer. I will make you complete, in fullness and in perfection, in every mystery that brings together all truths. You will receive the ultimate knowledge—what I wear now in my Vesture contains the perfection of all perfections, the fullness of all fullness, and the gnosis (spiritual knowing) of all gnoses.”**

**“I will tell you everything—from the outermost realities to the innermost truths. But first, listen closely, and I will share all that has happened to me.”**

### What it means

This short but powerful chapter marks a turning point. Jesus has now *put on his Vesture*—a symbolic act that means he is fully clothed in divine authority, wisdom, and light. It’s a moment of readiness: he is now able to teach the complete mystery, holding nothing back.

The repeated use of “fullness” and “perfection” isn’t just about knowledge—it’s about transformation. To know these mysteries is to become whole, to become like the Light from which all things come. It’s not just information Jesus promises—it’s *initiation into being*.

And what’s in his Vesture? The knowledge of all things. Outer and inner, surface and depth, appearance and essence. Nothing is to be left out anymore. The divine is no longer distant. It speaks directly to those who are ready.

### Reflection

1. What does it mean to you that divine wisdom is not being withheld, but fully offered?
2. Are there places in your life where you still feel separate from the “fullness of fullness” or “perfection of perfection”? What might help bridge that gap?
3. How would your life change if you truly believed that *nothing was being kept from you anymore*—that you are now being shown all things?
