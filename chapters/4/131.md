## Chapter 131 — The Origins of the Soul and the Mystery of Forgetfulness

Mary continued to question the Saviour: “My Lord, does the dragon of the outer darkness ever enter this world?”

**Of Sunlight and the Dragon’s Darkness**

Jesus replied: “When the light of the sun is above the world, it covers and holds back the darkness of the dragon. But when the sun goes beneath the world, the dragon’s darkness spreads like a veil. The breath of that darkness enters the world in the form of smoke at night. If the sun were to withdraw its rays completely, the world could not endure the dragon’s true form—it would be destroyed.”

Mary then asked: “My Lord, who causes people to sin?”

And Jesus said: “It is the rulers of Fate who compel souls toward sin.”

Mary asked again: “But do these rulers actually descend to earth and force people to sin?”

Jesus answered: “They do not descend directly. But when an old soul is about to return to the world, the rulers of Fate—who dwell in the region known as the head of the aeons, the kingdom of Adamas—prepare that soul to forget. This region faces the Virgin of Light.

The rulers give the soul a cup of forgetfulness, filled with the seed of wickedness, desires, and oblivion. When the soul drinks from this cup, it forgets all the regions it has visited and the punishments it has undergone. The cup becomes like a body outside the soul—a reflection of it in every way—called the counterfeiting spirit.”

**How New Souls Are Made**

Jesus continued: “If it is a new soul, not an old one, then it is formed from the sweat, tears, or breath of the rulers. Sometimes it is made from the refuse of the purification of the Light. In that case, Melchisedec takes the refuse and the five great rulers of Fate knead it together, each adding a portion. That is why every ruler has a stake in the soul, and all contribute to its formation.

Whether from sweat, tears, or refuse, the soul is made and shaped with the influence of the rulers, and to each one is bound the counterfeiting spirit, through the same cup of forgetfulness, which becomes like a false self—attached as a cloak around the true soul.”

**The Breath of Light Within**

Jesus went on: “The five rulers of Fate, along with the rulers of the sun and moon, breathe into that soul. And from them comes a portion of my own power, which the last Helper cast into the world. This inner Light remains within the soul and gives it consciousness, that it may always seek after the Light of the Heights.

This power looks just like the soul. It cannot exist outside of it, for I commanded it from the beginning to remain within for the sake of the great plan of salvation.

I will tell you more about all this at the time of the universe’s expansion: how souls are formed, what rulers shape them, what species of soul exist, and what names and powers they each have. I will explain the bonds and seals used by the rulers, how the counterfeiting spirit works, and the destiny assigned to each soul—even the souls of animals and rulers sent into the world.

All this I will reveal so that your gnosis may be complete.”

**The Soul, the Trap, and the Liberation**

Jesus summarized: “The rulers breathe into the soul, and with it they plant a portion of my Light. But outside the soul they place the counterfeiting spirit, which is bound and sealed to it. The rulers compel it constantly, forcing it into sin and worldly desires, so that it may serve them and remain trapped in the cycle of bodily change.

This is why I have brought the mysteries into the world—to break the seals of the counterfeiting spirit and free the soul from the rule of its false parents, the rulers. These mysteries refine the soul into pure Light and return it to the kingdom of its true Father—the First Mystery.

For this reason I once said:
‘Whoever does not abandon father and mother and follow me is not worthy of me.’

By this, I meant the rulers, the false parents of the soul. To abandon them is to become a true child of the Light—a child of the First Mystery, forever.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals the hidden architecture of the soul’s journey into the world. Souls forget their divine origin because they are given a cup of forgetfulness—filled with desires and shadows—by the rulers of fate. Worse still, they are cloaked in a counterfeiting spirit, a false self that mimics them and binds them to sin.

But within every soul is also a spark of Divine Light, a portion of Christ’s own power, planted there so that the soul might long for the truth and seek the Light.

This chapter pulls back the curtain on why we struggle to remember who we are. We are born into a system designed to make us forget. But the way out has been provided. The mysteries are not secret for exclusivity—they are keys to liberation, tools to sever the soul from its false entanglements and awaken the divine spark within.

### Reflection

* What does this chapter say about the purpose of spiritual forgetfulness?
* Can you sense the “counterfeiting spirit” in your own life—the false self that tempts you or leads you away from your true nature?
* How do you connect with the light power inside you—the part that remembers, that seeks, that knows the way back to the Light?
