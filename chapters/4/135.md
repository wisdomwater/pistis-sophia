# Chapter 135 — The Opening of the Light

Mary asked Jesus, “My Lord, before you came into the world—before you descended into the realms of the rulers—had any soul ever entered the Light?”

Jesus said: “Amen, amen, I tell you: Before I came into the world, no soul had entered the Light. But now that I have come, I have opened the gates to the Kingdom. I have revealed the paths that lead to the Light.

Whoever lives in a way that is worthy of the Mysteries may now receive them—and enter into the Light.”

Mary pressed further: “But Lord, I’ve heard that the prophets entered the Light. Is this not true?”

Jesus responded: “Amen, amen, I tell you: No prophet entered the Light. The rulers of the aeons only spoke with them from within the aeons. They gave them knowledge about the mysteries of the aeons—but not the Mysteries of the Light.

When I entered the regions of the aeons, I transformed Elias into the body of John the Baptizer, and I sent the others into righteous bodies— so they may discover the Mysteries of the Light and inherit the Light-Kingdom.

As for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I have forgiven their sins and iniquities, and I gave them the Mysteries of the Light from within the aeons. I placed them in the region of Yabraōth, among the rulers who have repented.

And when I return to the Highest Heights—into the full Light— I will bring their souls with me into the Light.

But amen, I say to you, Mary: They will not enter before you and your brothers and sisters.
I will bring your souls into the Light first.”

“All the righteous ones and patriarchs from the time of Adam until now who dwell in the aeons and under the rule of the archons— I have caused them, through the Virgin of Light, to take on new, righteous bodies.

These will be the ones who discover the Mysteries of the Light, And they will enter the Light-Kingdom.”

Mary said, “Blessed are we beyond all others, because of the wondrous Light you have revealed to us.”

Jesus answered, “I will continue to reveal everything— from the innermost interiors to the outermost exteriors, so that you may be made complete in divine knowledge, filled with the fullness of the Light, rooted in the heights of all heights, and grounded in the depths of all depths.”

Mary concluded: “My Lord, we now fully and clearly understand that you have brought us the keys to the Mysteries— mysteries that forgive sins, purify the soul,  transform it into refined Light, and lead it home to the Kingdom.”

## What it means

Before the coming of Christ, the gates to the Kingdom of Light were closed. Even prophets and patriarchs, despite their righteousness, could not enter.

But now, through Christ—the First Mystery—the way is open. He came not only to teach, but to transform, not only to forgive, but to refashion the soul into Light.

His work is cosmic, not just personal. He descended through all the layers of being, so that He could gather every soul—righteous and sinful—into wholeness.

## Reflection

* What does it mean that even the prophets needed transformation?
* Do you hear the invitation: that your soul is to enter first before even the patriarchs?
* Where in your life are you still waiting at a closed door, not realizing He has opened it?
