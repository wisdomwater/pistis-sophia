# Chapter 128 — How to Save the Soul of a Sinner

After hearing Jesus speak of the rulers of the dungeons, Mary and the disciples were deeply grieved. They struck their breasts, wept, and said: “Woe to sinners! Their punishments are so many and so severe!”

Mary came forward, fell at Jesus’ feet, kissed them, and said: “My Lord, please be patient with me. Do not be angry that I continue to question you. From now on, I will ask with fulll determination about everything.”

Jesus said to her: “Ask anything you wish, and I will explain it to you openly, without parables.”

Mary said: “My Lord, suppose a righteous person has received all the mysteries, and they have a close relative—someone who has committed all manner of sin, who has not repented, and who is now deserving of the outer darkness. Perhaps they have even completed all their cycles of rebirth and done nothing good. If that soul has now left the body, and we know they are suffering in the outer darkness, is there anything we can do to save them—so that they may return in a righteous body, find the mysteries of the Light, and ascend?”

Jesus answered: “If a soul is in the outer darkness or under other harsh judgments and has not repented—even if they have completed their circuits of rebirth in the body—then, yes, there is a way to help. If you want to rescue such a soul, perform the mystery of the Ineffable, the one that forgives sins at any time.

After you complete the mystery, say the following prayer: ‘The soul of [Name], whom I hold in my heart— If this soul is in the dungeons of the outer darkness, Or in any region of punishment— Let it be delivered from them all. If it has finished its cycle of incarnations, Let it be brought before the Virgin of Light, So she may seal it with the seal of the Ineffable, And cast it down into a righteous body That will discover the mysteries of the Light, Be made good, and ascend to the Light-kingdom.

If it has completed its circuits, let it be brought to the seven virgins of the Light, who preside over baptisms. Let them apply their baptism and seal it With the sign of the Kingdom of the Ineffable, and lead it into the orders of the Light.’

Amēn, I say to you: If that soul is in the dragon of the outer darkness, the dragon will release it. If it is under the judgment of the rulers, the receivers of Melchizedek will quickly retrieve it And carry it to the region of the Midst before the Virgin of Light.

She will test the soul to see if it bears the sign of the Kingdom. If the soul has not completed its cycle of rebirth, she will seal it with a special seal and cast it down into a body that will find the Light. If it has completed its cycles, she will hand it over to the seven virgins of the Light, who will baptize, anoint, and lead it to the Treasury of the Light. There it will remain in the last order until the great ascension of all perfected souls.

And when the veils of the right are ready to be parted, that soul will be cleansed again, Purified, and placed in the orders of the First Saviour who dwells in the Treasury of the Light.”

## What it means

This chapter reveals the intercessory power of the mysteries and the mercy of the Light. Even when a soul has fallen to the outer darkness—seemingly beyond all hope—it is not lost forever if those still living act on its behalf. By performing sacred mysteries and praying from the heart, one can rescue souls trapped in lower realms.

The Virgin of Light, the seven virgins, and the receivers of Melchizedek are spiritual agents of compassion and justice. They oversee rebirth, redemption, and the soul’s rightful place in the divine order. This passage teaches that even when a soul has done nothing good and failed in all its lifetimes, grace remains possible—if others love and act in sincerity.

There is a profound message here about spiritual responsibility and communal salvation. No soul is isolated. The prayers and actions of one can lift another. Forgiveness and liberation are not earned alone—they are woven into the mystery of love.

## Reflection

* Is there someone in your life—past or present—who you long to see healed or redeemed? What would it mean to hold them in your heart before the Light?
* How do you understand the concept of cycles of rebirth? Are there patterns in your own life that feel repetitive or in need of release?
* What does this chapter reveal to you about the power of sacred intention, prayer, and mystery in helping others beyond what seems possible?
