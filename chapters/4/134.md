## Chapter 134 – Discernment, the Books of Yew, and the Need for the Mysteries

Mary asked Jesus, “My Lord, if someone goes searching for truth but encounters false teachings, how are they supposed to know what truly comes from you?”

Jesus replied, “I’ve told you before — Be like wise money-changers: accept what is good and reject what is counterfeit.

Tell those who seek the Divine: ‘Just as you can read the signs of the wind—when the north wind comes, you prepare for cold; when the south wind comes, you expect heat — so too you must learn to read the signs of spiritual truth.

If someone comes claiming to teach of God, test their words. See whether they harmonize with what I’ve already spoken to you. Let their words be confirmed by at least two or three witnesses, and see if they align with the movements of heaven—the stars, the earth, the elements, and the flow of life.

If their message fits into the wholeness of divine understanding, the gnosis, then they belong to us. But if it leads to confusion or contradiction, they are not from the Light.’

Teach this to others so they may be protected from false teachings.”

**The Hidden Mysteries of the Books of Yew**

Jesus continued, “For the sake of sinners, I have torn myself away from the heights and come into the world to bring salvation. Even the righteous—those who’ve done no evil—still need to find the mysteries hidden in the Books of Yew.

Long ago, I had Enoch write these mysteries while he was in Paradise. I spoke with him from the Tree of Gnosis and the Tree of Life, and he wrote them down and hid them in the Rock of Ararad.

To protect them, I appointed a guardian: Kalapataurōth, the ruler over Skemmūt, whose head touches the foot of Yew and who encircles all aeons and fates. I placed him there to ensure the rulers would not destroy the Books out of jealousy—especially when the great flood came.

These Books, containing the highest mysteries, I will give you—once I reveal to you the full expansion of the universe.”

**Mary’s Honest Doubt**

Mary humbly asked, “My Lord, is there truly any human being who has never sinned? Even if someone is free of one kind of sin, surely they are not pure of every kind. How, then, can anyone be worthy to receive the mysteries in the Books of Yew?”

Jesus answered her, “You are right. Truly, it will be one in a thousand, or two in ten thousand, who are able to accomplish the mystery of the First Mystery.

This is why I came—why I tore myself from the heights—because all are under sin. All are in need of the gift of the mysteries.”

### What it means

Jesus invites us into a life of spiritual discernment, not blind faith. Just as we learn to read weather patterns, we must also learn to read truth—not just by the surface of words, but by their harmony with the Light.

The Books of Yew represent deep mystical truths, hidden and protected for the sake of the few who are ready. Even the most righteous are not exempt from needing divine grace. Purity is not found in perfection of behavior but in union with the Divine through mystery and Light.

Jesus speaks plainly: few will accomplish the highest mystery. Yet he does not say this to discourage us—but to show the immeasurable value of what he offers.

### Reflection

- Are you learning to recognize what is spiritually true by its harmony and fruit?
- Do you feel pressured to be perfect, or are you open to receiving the gift of grace and mystery?
- Can you honor how rare and precious it is to seek and receive divine gnosis in a world lost in confusion?
