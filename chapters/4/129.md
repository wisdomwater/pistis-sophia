## Chapter 129 – Light-Beams, Inheritance, and the Fate of Sinners

When Jesus had finished speaking about the fate of unrepentant souls and the power of the mysteries, Mary spoke again and said to him: “My Lord, I have heard you say: ‘He who receives the mysteries of the Ineffable or the First Mystery becomes a flame of light, a beam and stream of light that travels through all realms until it reaches its place of inheritance.’”

Jesus responded to her: “Yes, if someone receives the mystery while still alive in the body, and then dies, they become light-beams and light-streams. These souls penetrate through all realms without hindrance, reaching the region of their divine inheritance.

“But if they die in sin, having not repented, and if you then perform the mystery of the Ineffable for them—to rescue them from judgment and guide them into a righteous body that will inherit the Light—they will not become light-beams. Since they did not receive the mystery themselves during life, they cannot pass through the realms freely.

“Instead, the receivers of Melchisedec must accompany them. These receivers take the soul and guide it through various realms. The servants of the judges and rulers intercept these souls frequently, passing them from one to another, until finally they are brought before the Virgin of Light.”

### What it means

This chapter emphasizes the profound difference between receiving the mysteries directly through one's own conscious devotion and receiving help after death through the prayers of others.

Those who unite with the mysteries in life are transformed into living light—beings who can travel freely to their divine home. But even souls who fail in life are not entirely lost; through the mercy of intercession and the performance of sacred mysteries by others, they may still be guided toward redemption.

Yet, these latter souls must be carried, escorted, and passed through judgment, rather than moving by the power of their own Light. It is a slower, more uncertain path, reliant on the grace of those who act on their behalf and the compassion of divine intermediaries like the receivers of Melchisedec and the Virgin of Light.

The message is clear: seek the Light now, while you live, for it is the only way to walk the path unhindered and truly shine as a stream of light returning home.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to you to become a “beam of light” after death? What practices or intentions might guide you toward that state?
* Do you feel drawn to pray for or serve those who have died without healing? How might you do so?
* What is one way you can begin to consciously embody the Light during your life, rather than waiting for others to intervene later?
