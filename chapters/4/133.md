## Chapter 133 — Destiny, Mysteries, and the Way to the Light

Mary asked Jesus, “My Lord, does everything that happens to a person—whether good or bad, sin or death, life or joy—come to them because it was appointed by Fate? Is there no escape from what the rulers have destined for each of us?

Jesus replied, “Amen, I say to you: Everything that is appointed to a person by Fate—whether good or evil, righteousness or sin—does come to pass. No one escapes the destiny set by the rulers.”

“But this,” Jesus said, “is why I have come into the world and brought with me the keys to the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.

If these Mysteries had not come, no one—no flesh—could be saved. Not even the righteous. Not even the ones who tried to live good lives.

Because without the Mysteries, no one can enter the Kingdom of Light.

I have come for this very reason:
- To free sinners who believe in me and listen to my voice.
- To break the chains and seals that bind them to the rulers of the aeons.
- To rebind them instead to the Light—with new seals, new vestures, and a new inheritance.

What I loosen on Earth will be loosed in the Heights. What I bind to the Light on Earth will be bound to the Light above.

I have not kept these Mysteries hidden. I have spoken openly, offering them to all—righteous and sinners alike. I have said to everyone:

‘Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who seeks in truth will find, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.’

These Mysteries will purify you, make your soul refined, and lead you back into the Light.

**The Prophecy of John the Baptizer**

This is what John the Baptizer was speaking about when he said:

‘I baptize you with water for repentance and forgiveness. But the One coming after me is far greater than I. His fan is in his hand to clear the threshing floor. He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire and gather the wheat into his storehouse.’

The divine power within John knew that I would come to bring these Mysteries— To purify sinners, to refine them into Light, and to lead them into the fullness of the Kingdom.”

### What it means

This chapter affirms that destiny is real—but so is freedom through divine Mystery. Everything in this world moves according to the rulers’ appointed Fate, and no one escapes it… unless they receive the Mysteries of the Light.

These aren’t just secret teachings—they are keys that unlock our chains and rewrite our fate.

Jesus doesn’t reserve these Mysteries for the elite or perfect. He calls out to everyone, even sinners, even the weary and broken, and says:

“Come. You can be freed. Come. You can be made into Light.”

### Reflection

- Have you felt stuck in your destiny, as if life were repeating the same story?
- Do you believe that even you can be refined into Light, no matter your past?
- Where might you still be bound to the old fate, and what would it look like to receive a new inheritance?
