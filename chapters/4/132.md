# Chapter 132 — The Origins of the Soul, the Counterfeit Spirit, and the Mystery of Destiny

**Salome's Doubt and Mary’s Wisdom**

Salome, perplexed, asked Jesus: “My Lord, if our true parents are the rulers of fate and not our earthly ones, then how do we reconcile this with the Law of Moses, which says: *‘He who abandons father or mother shall die the death’*? Doesn’t the Law contradict your teaching?”

Before Jesus could answer, the divine light in Mary Magdalene stirred within her. She asked the Lord for permission to explain, and he blessed her and gave her permission to speak.

Mary lovingly embraced her sister Salome and said: “Sister, that verse from the Law does not refer to our physical parents, nor to the soul or the counterfeit spirit—for all these are created by the rulers. Rather, the Law speaks of the light-power that comes from the Saviour himself, the divine presence—the ‘light-man’ within us today. The Law says: *Whoever abandons this divine light and does not walk with the Saviour and his mysteries will not only die spiritually but be lost in ruin.*”

Salome embraced Mary in return, saying, “May the Saviour grant me understanding like yours.”

**The Counterfeit Spirit and the Fate of the Soul**

Jesus then revealed more: “The rulers seal a counterfeit spirit to each soul—not to torment it constantly, but to shadow and manipulate it when it forgets the mysteries of the Light.

If a soul, after leaving the body, has not spoken the sacred mysteries, nor broken the seals and bonds placed upon it, the counterfeit spirit is allowed to drag it through regions of judgment and suffering, punishing it for the sins the spirit itself caused it to commit.

But if the soul knows the mysteries, undoes the seals, and speaks the apologies of each region, then the spirit must release it. Such a soul belongs to the Light and is no longer under the rulers’ power.”

**The Journey into the Body**

The rulers of fate assign 365 servitor spirits to each soul. The soul consists of:

- The innermost Light-power, which gives it uprightness.
- The soul itself, seated in the middle.
- The counterfeiting spirit, which wraps around the outside.

The servitors bring the soul down from above and insert it into a body in the material world. The ruler of destiny, called Moira, follows the soul, guiding its life and death based on what has been ordained.

Here’s how it happens:

- The servitors divide the soul’s essence into two halves, one for the male and one for the female.
- They insert these halves into physical bodies—through breath, food, or water.
- Even if the two people are far apart, they are drawn together so that life may be conceived.

**The Womb and the Sealing of Life**

Once conception occurs:

- The 365 servitors gather in the womb.
- They withhold the woman’s nourishment for 40 days, shaping it into blood, which they knead into form.
- After 40 days, they spend another 30 days building the child’s body.
- Once the body is complete, they summon the counterfeit spirit, then the soul, then the Light-power.
- Destiny remains outside, following but not blended in.

They seal the child with divine markings:

- Left hand: the day the soul entered the womb
- Right hand: the day the body was completed
- Skull center: the day it was handed over by the rulers
- Left skull: the soul’s exit from the rulers
- Right skull: the day the members were formed
- Back of skull: when the counterfeit spirit was attached
- Brain and heart: when the Light-power was breathed in
- Forehead: the number of years it will live

These seals determine the child’s path, its trials, and its end.

**Death and the Role of Destiny**

Once born, the destiny spirit grows large, overshadowing the small soul and spirit within. Destiny does not reside inside the body but follows it throughout life, ensuring that it meets its appointed death.

Whether the person is to die by beast, accident, drowning, or some other means, destiny enforces the sentence set by the rulers of fate.

## What it means

This chapter paints a sobering but intricate picture of how souls are formed and woven into the material world. Each soul is bound by fate and accompanied by a counterfeit spirit, a shadow-self placed over it by the rulers of the aeons. This spirit mimics the soul and lures it into sin and forgetfulness.

But within the soul is also a spark of the Divine Light, placed there by the Saviour himself. It is small at first—just like a child—but it is the seed of freedom, the only part of us that can break the bonds and ascend to the Light.

Even destiny, so often misunderstood as impersonal fate, is shown to be a force enforcing the rulers’ will—a programmed outcome unless interrupted by divine awakening.

## Reflection

* Have you ever felt like part of you was working against your best intentions?
* Can you identify the voice or influence of the counterfeit self in your thoughts or behaviors?
* What helps you access the light within—the divine power that can recognize, resist, and break free from the seals of fate?
