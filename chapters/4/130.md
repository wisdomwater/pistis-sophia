# Chapter 130 — Mercy for the Negligent and the Power of Sacred Names

Mary continued and said to Jesus: “My Lord, if someone has received the mysteries of the Light from the outer regions, and when their allotted time has passed, they begin again to receive deeper mysteries within those already given—but become negligent and fail to say the prayer that purifies the food they eat—then, through the defilement of food, they fall again under the dominion of fate and the elements, and they sin once more.

“And if such a person dies before repenting and before receiving new mysteries that can forgive their sin, and we know that they have been taken into the dragon of the outer darkness due to their wrongdoing—and there is no one left in the world to help them, no compassionate soul to perform the mystery of the Ineffable on their behalf—what will happen to that soul? Will it remain in torment, even though it once suffered for God and endured persecution in faith?

“Have mercy, Lord, not only for our kin who might fall into this state but for all souls in this condition. You are the key that opens and closes the gates of the universe. Your mystery contains all. Even if a soul called upon your mysteries for just one day, and believed sincerely, not in pretense—grant them rest through your mercy.”

When Mary had spoken these words, the Saviour praised her greatly and was deeply moved with compassion. He said: “To all souls in this condition—those who die in sin after receiving mysteries, or those who never performed a mystery but knew one of the twelve names of the dragon of the outer darkness—give them the mystery of that name while they are still alive. I will reveal these names to you after I finish explaining the cosmos.”

**The Power of the Names of the Dragon**

Jesus continued: “If a soul knows one of the twelve names of the rulers of the dragon, even if they have sinned greatly and are bound in the dragon’s chastisements after death, the moment they speak that name, the dragon will be shaken violently. The door of the dungeon they are in will open, and the ruler of that dungeon will cast the soul out.

Immediately, the angels of Yew, the First Man, will rush in and carry the soul to him. Yew will test the soul. If it has not completed its earthly cycles, the receivers of Yew will hold it safely until the mystery of the Ineffable can be performed for it. Then it will be placed into a righteous body that will find the Light.

But if the soul has completed all its cycles and bears no sign or seal of the Ineffable, Yew will still have mercy. He will lead the soul to the seven virgins of the Light, who will baptize it—but without the spiritual chrism—and place it in a separate region of the Treasury of the Light. There, it will be safe from all torment until the final ascension of the universe.

At that time, the veils of the Light will be lifted. The soul will be purified anew, receive mysteries, and enter the last and lowest order of the Treasury of the Light. Even these souls will be saved from all judgment and punishment.”

**Mary Interprets the Teaching**

Jesus asked his disciples, “Have you understood what I’ve told you?”

Mary answered: “My Lord, this is like the parable you once gave: ‘Make friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you fail, you may be received into the everlasting dwellings.’ Who is the Mammon of unrighteousness if not the dragon of the outer darkness?

Whoever knows the mystery of one of the dragon’s names, and speaks it—even if they are trapped in the outer darkness—they will be saved and received into the Treasury of the Light. This, my Lord, is the meaning of your word.”

And the Saviour replied: “Well said, you spiritual and pure one. That is indeed the correct interpretation.”

## What it means

This chapter is one of the most hopeful in Pistis Sophia. It reveals that even souls who have failed, neglected, or fallen back into sin are not abandoned, if they had even once sincerely called on the Light or known its mysteries.

Through intercessory knowledge—knowing even a single sacred name—there is still a path to freedom, even from the deepest darkness. The Light has made keys for every lock, and the gatekeepers of mercy stand ready to act when a soul cries out.

The dragon, which once devoured and imprisoned, is shaken by the sound of Light’s true name.

This is a reminder that knowledge alone is not salvation, but true knowledge wedded with sincerity, humility, and openness to the Light—even if brief—is enough to call forth divine compassion.

## Reflection

* What does this chapter teach you about the depth of divine mercy?
* How might sacred names, words, or prayers function in your life as tools of liberation, not superstition?
* What responsibility do you feel for remembering the forgotten, or praying for those who can no longer pray for themselves?
