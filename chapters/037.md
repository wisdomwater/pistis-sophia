## Chapter 37 – The Promise of Spiritual Fulfillment and Sophia’s Third Repentance

Jesus responded to Peter, saying:

“Well done, Peter. That is the true interpretation of Sophia’s repentance. You are blessed—more than anyone else on earth—because I’ve revealed these deep mysteries to you. Truly, truly, I tell you: I will make you complete, filling you with all the mysteries, from the innermost to the outermost, and I will fill you with the Spirit.

You will be called ‘spiritual ones, perfected in fullness.’ And I also tell you this: I will entrust you with all the mysteries of every realm—of my Father’s kingdom and of the First Mystery—so that whoever you welcome on earth will be welcomed into the Light above, and whoever you cast out will be cast out from the Father’s kingdom in heaven.

Now listen closely and pay attention to every word of the repentances that Pistis Sophia has spoken.”

Then Jesus continued, introducing her third repentance:

**Sophia’s Third Repentance:**

1. O Light of all powers, hear me and save me.

2. Let those who try to steal my light fall into lack and darkness. Let those who try to drain my power fall into chaos and shame.

3. May those who oppress me and claim dominion over me quickly fall into the shadows.

4. But may all who seek the Light rejoice! May those who long for your mystery always say: “Let the mystery be exalted!”

5. Save me now, O Light, for I have lost the light they took from me. I need the power they stripped away. You alone are my savior and deliverer, O Light. Save me quickly from this chaos.

### What it means

Jesus affirms that the disciples—despite their imperfections and confusion—are on the path to spiritual wholeness. He promises to fill them with the fullness of the mysteries and the Spirit, transforming them into “spiritual ones.” He also grants them spiritual authority: what they do on earth will resonate in heaven. It’s a radical affirmation of their purpose and power.

Then, he returns to the voice of Sophia, who continues her plea. In this third repentance, her cry is both defiant and faithful. She curses those forces that tried to extinguish her light and calls for their return to chaos. At the same time, she lifts up others on the path—those who seek the Light—and urges them to keep exalting the sacred mystery.

Her voice becomes a rallying cry for all who feel spiritually robbed, lost, or powerless. Her faith is fierce. Even in the chaos, she still believes the Light will save her.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to you to be “perfected in fullness”? How might that look in your life?
* Are there parts of your own light or power that feel taken or diminished? How do you seek restoration?
* When you witness others suffering, do you align more with Sophia’s prayer for justice or with her call to rejoice in the Light?
