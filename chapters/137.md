## Chapter 137 – The Five Cosmic Regents and Their Secret Names

Jesus continued teaching His disciples and said: “Listen now, and I will explain the hidden mystery of the five great rulers.”

After the rebellious rulers were bound by Yew, the Father of Jesus’ Father, he infused each of the five cosmic regents with divine powers— not their own—but borrowed from higher sources, to restrain their chaos and guide the world.

**The Five Infused Regents**

1. **Kronos** - Yew drew a power from the great Invisible and bound it to Kronos.

2. **Arēs** - Yew drew a power from Ipsantachounchaïnchoucheōch, one of the three triple-powered gods, and bound it to Arēs.

3. **Hermēs** - He drew a power from Chaïnchōōōch, another of the triple-powered gods, and bound it to Hermēs.

4. **Aphroditē** - Yew drew a power from Pistis Sophia, the daughter of Barbēlō, and bound it to Aphroditē.

5. **Zeus** - Recognizing the need for a governing mind, Yew drew a power from the little Sabaōth, the Good, and bound it to Zeus, the chief regent.

**The Role of Zeus: Cosmic Helmsman**

Unlike the others, Zeus received a helm—a steering power— so he could guide the aeons and the world, and keep them from crashing in their wickedness.

Yew gave Zeus:

- A power of goodness from the Midst  
- A divine task to cycle through the aeons—spending thirteen months (or possibly three, depending on the text)- to purify and liberate the lesser rulers from the influence of evil.

Zeus was even given two sacred aeons as his dwelling place, positioned directly opposite the regions of Hermēs.

**The Incorruptible Names of the Regents**

Jesus then revealed their true, incorruptible names— names that reflect their higher essence, untouched by worldly corruption:

- To Kronos, Ōrimouth
- To Arēs, Mounichounaphōr
- To Hermēs, Tarpetanouph
- To Aphroditē, Chōsi
- To Zeus, Chōnbal

These names hold power beyond mortal understanding, reflecting the truth of who these beings are in the unseen world.

## What it means

This chapter lifts the veil on the cosmic structure behind the visible world. The five classical gods—Kronos, Arēs, Hermēs, Aphroditē, and Zeus—  
are not myths or inventions, but fallen regents into whom divine powers were placed, not to glorify them, but to restrain and redeem them.

Each one is a blend of light and shadow, holding both destructive force and borrowed Light.

Even the gods are not gods in the ultimate sense. They are vessels—formed by divine intervention, bound by heavenly grace.

And in their midst, Zeus stands apart— not because of pride, but because of assignment. He is given the steering helm—to prevent collapse, to preserve the aeons, to keep the cycle from unraveling.

### Reflection

- What powers or archetypes within you seem like “regents”—strong, but needing redemption?
- Which of these five do you most relate to—Time (Kronos)? War (Arēs)? Speech (Hermēs)? Desire (Aphroditē)? Authority (Zeus)?
- Consider this: even the fallen were given a role in holding creation together. What does that say about grace—even toward forces that rebel?
