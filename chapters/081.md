## Chapter 81 – Sophia Returns Home

When Jesus finished telling his disciples all that had happened to Pistis Sophia during her time in the chaos—how she had cried out to the Light to save her, how she was delivered from her suffering and brought through the twelve aeons—he continued speaking:

“After all these things, I took Pistis Sophia and led her into the thirteenth aeon. I was shining with unimaginable brilliance, my Light beyond all measure. I entered the realm of the twenty-four invisibles, still radiating this immense Light. They were shaken by my presence. They recognized Sophia, who was with me, but they didn’t recognize who I was. They assumed I was an emanation from the realm of Light.

When Sophia saw her companions—the other invisibles—she was filled with immense joy and celebration. She wanted to tell them all the wonders that had happened to her when I rescued her from the world below. She stood among them and sang this song of praise:

1. I thank you, O Light—you are my savior, my eternal deliverer.

2. I will sing this song to the Light, for it rescued me from the hands of my enemies.

3. You have kept me safe in every realm—rescued me from the heights, from the depths of chaos, and from the aeons ruled by the archons.

4. When I left the heights, I wandered in places where no Light was found, and I couldn’t return to the thirteenth aeon, my home.

5. I had no Light or power left in me; I was completely drained.

6. Yet the Light rescued me from all my pain. I praised it, and it listened when I was trapped.

7. The Light guided me through the aeons and led me back to the thirteenth aeon, my true home.

8. I thank you, O Light, for saving me and for the miracles you have done for humanity.

9. When I had no strength, you gave me strength. When I had no Light, you filled me with pure Light.

10. I was trapped in darkness, bound in chaos, with no Light left within me.

11. I had defied the Light’s command and left my rightful place. I stirred up its anger through my disobedience.

12. When I descended, I lost my Light and no one came to help.

13. But in my suffering, I praised the Light, and it delivered me.

14. It shattered my chains and lifted me from the darkness and pain of chaos.

15. I thank you, O Light, for saving me and for your miracles in the world of humanity.

16. You broke the gates of darkness and smashed the great locks of chaos.

17. You allowed me to leave the realm where I had gone astray and lost my Light.

18. I had abandoned the mysteries and descended to the gates of chaos.

19. When I was trapped, I praised the Light, and it saved me.

20. You sent your stream of power to strengthen me and free me from all my suffering.

21. I thank you, O Light, for saving me and for your wondrous works in humanity.”

This is the song Pistis Sophia sang in the presence of the twenty-four invisibles. She wanted them to know all the miraculous things I had done for her and to understand that I had gone down into the world of human beings to give them the mysteries of the Higher Realms. Now, if anyone feels elevated in their understanding, let them come forward and explain the meaning of her song.

### What it means

This chapter is a homecoming—a return to divine belonging after a long, painful exile. Sophia’s journey mirrors our own: we fall, we forget, we become entangled in the shadows of this world. We lose our Light. We suffer. We try to fix it ourselves. And when we finally surrender and call out to the Light, it comes—not to punish, but to restore.

Sophia’s song is the soul’s testimony. She speaks as one who has passed through deathlike suffering, abandonment, and guilt—but also as one who has been utterly redeemed. Her story echoes the pattern of spiritual transformation: descent, brokenness, calling out, rescue, and resurrection. It is the journey of every soul who longs for reunion with the Source.

Symbolically, this chapter represents the moment of integration—the psyche returning to wholeness. The “twenty-four invisibles” are higher faculties of being, perhaps aspects of divine consciousness or angelic presences. Sophia’s presence among them signifies the reintegration of the lost part of the self. Her testimony affirms that the Light does not abandon us when we stray; instead, it waits patiently for our cry and rushes to meet us when we turn back.

The Light is more than a distant deity—it is the divine presence within, ever ready to flow, to cleanse, to empower. Sophia's words remind us: no matter how deep our chaos, the Light can reach deeper. No matter how lost we feel, there is a way home.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt like Sophia—cut off from your source, powerless, and alone?
* What “song” might you sing to the Light from your own life experience?
* How might your own journey of return encourage others who are still wandering in the chaos?
