## Chapter 90 — The Orders of Light

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene came forward again and asked:

“My Lord, what will happen to those who have received the mystery of the Light while in the realm of the last Helper? What will they be like?”

Jesus answered her:

“Those who have received the mysteries of the Light—when they leave their physical bodies, which come from the material world of the rulers—they will be placed in the proper order, depending on the mystery they received.
Those who received *higher* mysteries will belong to *higher* realms, and those with *lower* mysteries will belong to *lower* realms.

In short, every soul will dwell in the region that corresponds to the level of mystery they received in this life, and this will be their place in the Inheritance of the Light. That’s why I told you before: ‘Where your heart is, there your treasure will be also.’ In other words, your spiritual location will match your inner devotion and depth.”

After Jesus said this, John stepped forward and said:

“My Lord and Savior, please allow me to speak also. Don’t be upset if I ask for exact and clear answers—because you promised to reveal everything to us when we ask. So please don’t hold anything back from us.”

Jesus replied with great compassion:

“To you also, blessed and beloved John, I give permission to speak freely. Ask whatever you like, and I will reveal it to you directly and clearly—without using symbols or riddles.”

Then John asked:

“My Lord, will each soul stay only in the region that matches the mystery they received? Will they have no ability to move up to higher levels—or even to move down to lower ones?”

### What It Means

This chapter explores spiritual development as a process of growing into the level of divine truth a person is ready for. In Jesus’ answer, there’s a deep emphasis on personal alignment—where your consciousness is, that’s where you belong. The “mysteries” represent sacred knowledge or inner transformation. The more deeply a soul has embraced the Light, the higher the realm it enters.

But John raises an important question: once someone reaches a certain level, are they locked there? Is spiritual movement—up or down—possible after death?

The chapter ends with that question open, setting the stage for Jesus’ reply in the next section.

### Reflection

1. When Jesus says, “Where your heart is, there your treasure will be,” how does that speak to your spiritual focus right now?
2. Do you resonate with the idea of “levels” of spiritual understanding or maturity? How do you see this in your own journey?
3. Mary asks what happens after death. John asks whether growth continues afterward. How do you personally imagine the soul’s journey beyond this life?
