## Chapter 15 — The Tyrants Resist the Light

Jesus said:

“When all the beings within the twelve Aeons saw the incredible light around me, they were thrown into confusion. They ran back and forth in a panic, not understanding what was happening.

The entire structure of the Aeons and the heavens began to shake, as fear spread everywhere—because they did not recognize the mystery that had just unfolded.

Then Adamas, the Great Tyrant, along with all the other tyrants of the Aeons, began to resist the Light. But they fought in vain. They couldn’t see who or what they were fighting—only that the light was overpowering.

As they struggled against it, their strength faded, and they were thrown down into the Aeons, becoming like mortals—lifeless and powerless.

I then took from them one-third of their power, so they could no longer carry out their evil works.

This was to ensure that if people on Earth call upon these powers—through dark rituals or forbidden magic passed down by fallen angels—they would no longer be able to cause harm.

And I also changed the movement of their spheres. Originally, they moved only to the left, influencing the world in a consistent pattern, as they were set that way by Yew, the Overseer of Light, under the command of the First Mystery.

Now, I have altered this: for six months they turn to the left, and for the other six months they turn to the right, balancing their effects on the world.”

### What it means

This chapter shows the cosmic impact of Jesus’ return to the higher realms. His presence is so radiant that even the highest powers are confused, afraid, and thrown into disorder.

Adamas and the tyrants—symbolizing oppressive, controlling spiritual forces—try to fight back against the Light. But it’s a losing battle. They are overwhelmed and reduced to a shadow of their former power.

Jesus removes a third of their influence, not to destroy them, but to prevent them from doing harm—especially when people attempt to invoke them through magic or hidden rituals.

He also restores balance. The cosmic powers no longer exert a single, relentless influence—they now alternate directions, symbolizing the beginning of a harmonized rhythm instead of tyranny.

This reflects the idea that true Divine Light doesn’t just overpower evil—it transforms the cosmic order, weakening what is harmful and restoring balance to creation.

### Reflection

* Are there inner tyrants—thoughts, habits, or fears—that resist the Light within you? How do they react when you stand in truth or clarity?
* What might it mean to “lose a third of their power”? How can you begin to disempower the things that control or oppress you?
* Where in your life could you restore balance by allowing influence to shift—by no longer moving in one direction alone?
* What does it mean to you that the tyrants fought a light they couldn’t see—only its effects? Are there unseen forces of good at work in your life, quietly unraveling old patterns?
