## Chapter 87 — The Last Shall Be First

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said:

“My Lord, the light within me hears and understands every word you say. About what you just taught—that all human souls who receive the mysteries of the Light will enter the Inheritance of the Light before any of the rulers who repent, and before those in the region of the Right, and even before those in the Treasury of the Light—this reminds me of something you told us earlier:

‘The first will be last, and the last will be first.’

I understand now that the ‘last’ refers to the human race, which will actually enter the Light-Kingdom before all the higher beings and rulers who came first. That’s why you said, ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear’—you wanted to see if we truly understood the deeper meaning behind your words. That’s what I believe you meant.”

When Mary finished speaking, the Savior was deeply moved and amazed by her insight. She had become fully a being of pure spirit.

Jesus said to her:
“Well spoken, Mary—spiritual and pure. You’ve understood it perfectly.”

### What It Means

Mary Magdalene demonstrates deep spiritual understanding. She connects Jesus’ teaching about the order of souls entering the Light with his earlier saying that “the last will be first.” In this Gnostic view, human beings—though lower in the cosmic hierarchy—have a unique destiny. Through receiving the mysteries, they can ascend ahead of even the rulers and spiritual beings who were “first.”

Mary’s recognition that true spiritual insight isn’t about rank but about transformation aligns with a core theme in the *Pistis Sophia*: that the soul’s journey and purification are what ultimately matter. Her being called “pure spirit” shows how far she has progressed—she’s no longer just understanding spiritually; she has *become* spiritual.

### Reflection

* What might it mean in your life that “the last shall be first”?
* How does this teaching challenge conventional ideas about power, status, or worthiness?
* Can you relate to Mary’s process of listening deeply and understanding with your “inner light”?
