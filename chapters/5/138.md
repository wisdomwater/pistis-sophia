## Chapter 138 — The Promise of All Mysteries

When the disciples heard what Jesus had revealed, they fell to the ground in reverence and worship, saying, “We are more blessed than anyone, because you have shown us these incredible wonders.”

They begged him, “Please, Lord, reveal to us—what are these ‘ways’ you speak of?”

Mary came close, bowed before him, kissed his hands, and asked, “My Lord, what purpose do the Ways of the Midst serve? We've heard from you that these paths are places of intense judgment and suffering. How can we avoid them? How do they trap souls? How long do souls remain there, enduring these punishments? Have mercy on us, Lord and Savior, so that the keepers of these judgments won’t seize our souls and condemn us. Let us instead inherit the Light of your Father and not be left abandoned without you.”

Jesus, deeply moved by Mary’s tears and their devotion, answered with great compassion:

“Truly, my beloved brothers and sisters—you who have left behind your homes, your families, and everything for my name—I will give you all the mysteries and all the knowledge.

I will give you the mystery of the twelve aeons of the ruling powers—their seals, their sacred codes, and the invocations needed to reach them.

I will give you the mystery of the thirteenth aeon and how to call upon it, including its symbols and seals.

I will give you the mystery of baptism for those in the realm of the Midst, including how to reach them and the seals and signs associated with them.

I will give you the baptism of those who belong to the Right—that is, our realm of Light—with all its signs and symbols and the invocations for entering.

And I will give you the great mystery of the Treasury of the Light, and how to reach it.

I will give you everything—every mystery and all divine knowledge—so that you may be called the ‘children of the Fullness,’ perfected in all spiritual understanding.

Truly, you are more blessed than anyone on earth, for the children of the Light have come into the world during your lifetime.”

### What it means

This chapter is a moment of deep intimacy between Jesus and his disciples, especially Mary. She pleads for clarity and protection—not just for herself, but for all souls who long to escape the grip of judgment and suffering. Her question is profoundly human: *How can we avoid the traps and punishments of the unseen world? How can we be free?*

Jesus responds not with fear, but with a gift: the full transmission of divine mysteries. This is not information for its own sake. Each mystery he offers—each aeon, baptism, seal, or cipher—represents a stage of liberation, a key that unlocks a deeper level of reality and consciousness.

In psychological terms, the Ways of the Midst may represent the transitional states of the soul—the liminal spaces between shadow and light, ego and spirit. These are the places where we are tested, judged, and often feel stuck. But Jesus says we are not powerless. He offers tools—spiritual disciplines, insights, initiations—that allow us to pass through these places and rise into Light.

To be a “child of the Fullness” is to be someone whose inner life is integrated—who has touched every part of themselves, even the dark or punished parts, and brought them into healing through divine knowledge.

This is the heart of the mystical path: we are not condemned. We are given everything we need to return home.

### Reflection

* Where do you feel stuck or judged in my life—caught between worlds?
* What mysteries (practices, teachings, or truths) have already helped you move toward inner freedom?
* How would you live if you truly believed that you had been entrusted with divine knowledge meant to free yourself and others?
