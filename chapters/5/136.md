## Chapter 136 — The Prayer at the Ocean and the Division of the Rulers

After Jesus was crucified and rose again on the third day,
His disciples gathered around Him, fell at His feet, and said:

“Lord, have mercy on us! We have left our homes, our families—everything—to follow You.”

Then Jesus stood with His disciples on the water of the Ocean and prayed with deep invocation:

“Hear me, my Father— Father of all fatherhood, Boundless Light…”

He spoke a series of divine, sacred names, including:
*iaō, ieou, sabaōth*, and many others—mystic names echoing the divine fullness.

While Jesus prayed:

- Thomas, Andrew, James, and Simon the Zealot stood in the west, facing east.
- Philip and Bartholomew stood in the south, facing north.
- The rest of the disciples and the women followers stood behind Him.
- And Jesus stood at the altar, surrounded by His initiates, all clothed in linen.

As Jesus turned toward the four directions, He repeated the sacred sound:

*iaō*

Then He explained its meaning:

- Iōta (I): The universe has gone forth.
- Alpha (A): It will one day return.
- Omega (Ō): The completion of all things.

Jesus prayed:

*“Iaphtha, Iaphtha. Mounaēr, Mounaēr. Ermanouēr, Ermanouēr.*

O Father of all fatherhood, You who dwell in the Boundless Realms— Hear me for the sake of these disciples I have brought before You. May they believe in Your truth. I call upon You, because I know the Name of the Father of the Treasury of the Light.”

Then Jesus—also called Aberamenthō—spoke the name of the Father of the Light’s Treasury. At that moment, all the heavens, archangels, and hidden powers moved. The heavens rolled westward, as did the aeons, the celestial sphere, and all the rulers.

The sun appeared as a great dragon, its tail in its mouth, pulled by four white horses. The moon looked like a ship, steered by a male and female dragon and drawn by two white bulls.

At its stern stood a childlike figure guiding the dragons who steal light from the rulers. At its prow was the face of a cat.

Even the mountains, seas, and the whole world turned westward—toward the Left.

But Jesus and His disciples remained in the air,
in the region known as the Way of the Midst, which lies just below the celestial sphere.

They reached the first order of the Way of the Midst and stood in its air.

The disciples asked:

“Lord, where are we now?"

Jesus replied: “This is the Way of the Midst. Long ago, the rulers of Adamas rebelled, creating new rulers, angels, and powers through unlawful congress. Then Yew, the Father of My Father, came from the Right and bound them all to a fate-driven sphere.

There are twelve aeons: The first six were ruled by Sabaōth, the Adamas. The other six were ruled by his brother, Yabraōth.

Yabraōth repented and had faith in the Light-Mysteries. He abandoned the path of corruption. But Sabaōth and his rulers did not repent. They clung to the lower mysteries of generation and power.”

Yew took Yabraōth and his faithful rulers and placed them in purified air, near the light of the sun. But Sabaōth and his followers were bound to the fate-driven sphere.

He assigned: 1,800 rulers in every aeon. 360 chief rulers over them. And five great rulers to govern all:

1. Kronos
2. Arēs
3. Hermēs
4. Aphroditē
5. Zeus

These names are known in the world—but their roots trace to bound cosmic powers.

### What it means

This is one of the most mystical, apocalyptic chapters in Pistis Sophia. It shows us that Christ, the Revealer, is not only earth’s teacher,
but the Initiator of the cosmos itself.

He speaks names of power, rearranges the celestial realms, and unites His disciples in sacred prayer and orientation, revealing that their devotion links them to the entire structure of the heavens.

The cosmos is not random—it is patterned, layered, and governed. But not all powers are aligned with the Light.
Some rebelled. Some repented. And some were bound.

### Reflection

* How do you respond to the idea that some spiritual forces repent, while others remain in rebellion?
* Jesus prayed not for show, but to invoke real change in the heavens. What kinds of prayers stir your soul to believe that transformation is possible?
* Are there ways you can face each “direction” of your life—north, south, east, and west—and bring Christ’s Light there?
