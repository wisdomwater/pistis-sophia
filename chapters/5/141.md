## Chapter 141 – The Mysteries of Forgiveness and Light

After hearing Jesus describe the painful torments of the rulers of the Midst, the disciples fell to the ground in fear and awe, crying out: “Lord, have mercy on us! Save us from these terrible punishments meant for the souls lost in sin. Woe to humanity, for we wander blindly in darkness, unaware of what awaits. Evil powers lie in wait to devour our souls like lions waiting to pounce. Because of our ignorance, we are prey to their judgment. Please, have mercy on us and on all people.”

Jesus comforted them: “Do not be afraid. You are blessed. I will give you authority over all these dark powers, and they will be placed under your feet. Remember when I told you before my crucifixion, ‘I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven’? Now I will indeed give them to you.”

Then Jesus sang a sacred song of praise, invoking the great name. The lower realms faded away, and he and his disciples were lifted into a realm of overwhelming Light. He called them to him, spoke a sacred name over their heads, blessed them, and breathed into their eyes.

“Look,” he said.

They looked up and saw a Light so great it could not be described. Then he told them to look away from the Light. When they did, they saw fire, water, wine, and blood.

Jesus said: “When I came into the world, I brought only these: fire, water, wine, and blood. The fire and water came from the Light of the Treasury of Light; the wine and blood came from Barbēlō’s realm. Later, my Father sent the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.

The fire, water, and wine purify the sins of the world. The blood is a sign of the human body I took on from Barbēlō, the great power of the Invisible God. And the breath I’ve given you moves into all souls, leading them back to the Light.

This is why I said, ‘I came to cast fire upon the earth’—to purify it. And to the Samaritan woman I said, ‘If you knew the gift of God, you would ask, and I would give you living water.’ I also blessed a cup of wine and gave it to you saying, ‘This is my blood, poured out for the forgiveness of sins.’ And when the spear pierced my side, water and blood came forth. These are the mysteries of the Light that forgive sins—they are the sacred names of the Light.”

Then Jesus commanded the powers of the Left to return to their places. He and the disciples descended again to the Mount of Galilee.

The disciples asked: “How long must we wait for our sins to be forgiven? When will we be made worthy of your Father’s Kingdom?”

Jesus replied: “Amen, I tell you this: Not only will I cleanse your sins, but I will make you worthy of the Kingdom. I will give you the mystery of the forgiveness of sins—so that whoever you forgive on earth will be forgiven in heaven, and whoever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. I will give you the mystery of the Kingdom itself, so you may offer these blessings to others.”

### What it means

This chapter is a moment of spiritual reassurance. After hearing about the dark forces that ensnare the soul, the disciples cry out—not just for themselves, but for all of humanity. Their fear is real, but so is their compassion.

Jesus responds not with further warnings, but with grace. He opens their spiritual eyes to the mystical essence of his mission: fire, water, wine, and blood. These elements represent purification, transformation, communion, and the incarnation of the Divine into flesh. They are not just symbolic; they are spiritual forces that cleanse, unify, and return the soul to the Light.

The breath he gives—the Holy Spirit—is the animating presence that awakens divine remembrance in each soul. And the greatest gift he offers is participation: the disciples are not passive recipients but empowered agents of forgiveness and healing. He gives them keys—not just to escape suffering, but to unlock the Light for others.

This chapter reminds us: even in a world full of blindness and injustice, we are not abandoned. We are given tools. We are given mysteries. And we are called to extend forgiveness and spiritual liberation to others.
