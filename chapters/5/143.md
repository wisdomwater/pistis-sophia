# Chapter 143 — The Mysteries That Lead to the Light

The disciples said to Jesus: “Rabbi, you’ve spoken of a fire baptism, a baptism of the Holy Spirit of the Light, and a spiritual anointing (chrism). Please reveal these to us, so that we may enter your Father’s Kingdom.”

Jesus replied: “These mysteries you ask about are the most powerful of all. They lead the soul into the Light of lights—into the realm of Truth, Goodness, and Holiness. In that highest region, there is no male or female, no form at all—only everlasting, indescribable Light.

“There is nothing greater than these mysteries, except one: the mystery of the Seven Voices, their forty-nine powers, and their sacred codes. And above all names, there is one name—a name that contains every name, every light, and every power.

“If someone truly knows this name, then when they leave the body, nothing in the lower worlds—no darkness, no ruler, no angel or power—can hold them back. If they speak this name, even fire and shadow are overcome. The demons and dark authorities tremble, fall, and cry out: ‘Holy, holy, you are most holy of all!’

“Even Barbēlō, the invisible god, and the triple-powered beings fall silent before it, crying: ‘O Light of all lights, who dwells in the infinite—remember us, purify us!’”

At these words, the disciples wept aloud, overcome with awe and longing.

## What it means

This chapter reveals the deepest esoteric truths of the Pistis Sophia: that there are sacred initiations—fire, Spirit, and anointing—that lead the soul into the ultimate reality: the formless, genderless Light beyond all illusion.

Here, salvation is not about external rituals alone, but about entering the very nature of divine being. It’s about awakening to a realm where there is no separation, no shadow—only radiant presence. The "name above all names" is not a word to be memorized, but a state of being, an alignment with the frequency of the divine.

This name is power. It dissolves all barriers. It quells fear, burns away deception, and opens the path beyond karma, form, and fate. When the soul is ready, when it has been prepared through love, surrender, and spiritual practice, even the greatest beings in the spiritual hierarchy bow before the light it carries.

This is the path of return. The path of the awakened.

## Reflection

* What does it mean to live in a way that prepares the soul to receive such mysteries?
* How can you begin to hear the "seven voices" within yourself—those deeper truths that call you into alignment?
* What is the "name above all names" for you—not just in words, but in presence, in how I live?
