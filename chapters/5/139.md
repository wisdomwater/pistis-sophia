## Chapter 139 — The Power of Paraplēx and the Struggle for the Soul

Jesus continued, saying: “Then the father of my father—Yew—took 360 rulers from among the followers of Adamas, the ones who did not believe in the Light, and bound them to the lower aerial regions—where we are now, just below the celestial sphere. Over them he placed five powerful rulers to govern what is called the ‘Way of the Midst.’”

“The first of these rulers is named Paraplēx. She appears in the form of a woman, with hair that reaches down to her feet. Under her authority are 25 arch-demons who in turn rule over countless other demons. These are the beings who possess humans, inciting them to rage, blasphemy, and slander. When people die, these demons sometimes snatch their souls away, dragging them into realms of smoke, torment, and destruction.”

Mary spoke again, respectfully yet boldly: “Lord, I hope you’re not angry with me for asking so many questions. But I want to understand clearly, so my brothers can understand too. How exactly do these beings carry off souls?”

Jesus answered her with compassion:

“Yew, the father of my father, watches over all the rulers, gods, and powers who came from the matter of Light. And Zorokothora Melchisedec is the one who gathers the purified lights and leads them to the Treasury of the Light. These two—Yew and Melchisedec—are the great Lights who descend to the rulers and help purify them. When the proper time arrives, they go down and constrain the rulers, removing the Light that has been trapped within them and carrying it back upward.

But once their work is complete and they return to the realms of the Right and the Treasury, the rulers—left unchecked—begin to rebel. They surge upward in anger, capturing any souls they can, consuming them in dark smoke and fire. 

Paraplēx, in particular, takes the souls of those who lived with intense rage, cursing, and slander. She subjects them to terrifying torments: her fire burns away their form until they begin to dissolve. These souls are trapped in her realm for 133 years and 9 months of unrelenting punishment.

Yet even this ends. When the cosmic cycle turns and the great Sabaōth (Zeus), known as the Good, reaches the right astrological alignment—when the goddess Boubastis (Aphrodite) is in the Balance—then the veils between the Right and the Left part. The Good Sabaōth gazes down, and all creation trembles. His glance dissolves Paraplēx’s realm, and the tortured souls are released—though broken—into the world once again.”

### What it means

This chapter dives deep into the spiritual mechanics of judgment, purification, and liberation. Paraplēx is not merely a demon; she represents a psychological and spiritual force—perhaps the destructive power of unprocessed rage and bitter speech. Her dominion is over those who live from these energies, and after death, they remain entangled in them.

But notice something important: her power is not eternal. Though she torments, her domain is eventually dissolved by Light. The gaze of the Good Sabaōth—symbolizing divine compassion and justice—breaks the tyranny of the shadow. Even the most tormented soul is not abandoned forever. There is always hope, always a returning cycle of grace.

This speaks to our inner lives as well. When we are consumed by anger or bitterness, it may feel like we are in an endless cycle of punishment. But when we turn toward the Light—when we allow divine compassion to “gaze” upon us—those inner torments begin to dissolve. 

The cosmic myth here reflects a personal truth: the powers that oppress our souls can be overcome through divine help, healing, and inner transformation. We are not condemned to darkness forever.

### Reflection

* In what ways do anger, slander, or bitterness trap your energy and cloud your spirit?
* What “demons” of the past do you feel still hold power over you, and what would it look like to invite the Light into those places?
* Can you trust that even your darkest patterns are not beyond healing—that the gaze of the Good still seeks you?
