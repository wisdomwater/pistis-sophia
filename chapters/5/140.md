## Chapter 140 – The Five Rulers of the Midst and the Purification of the Soul

Jesus continued teaching, saying: “The second order of the Way of the Midst is ruled by Ariouth the Ethiopian, a female power with a dark appearance. She commands fourteen arch-demons who lead many others. These demons enter those who are drawn to conflict, stirring up anger, violence, and murder. Souls taken by Ariouth are tormented for 113 years in her realm, where they suffer through darkness and fire until nearly destroyed.

But when the cosmic cycle shifts—when Zeus (the little Sabaōth, the Good) enters the sign of Cancer, and Aphrodite (Boubastis) enters Capricorn—the veils between Right and Left part. Yew looks upon the realm of Ariouth, and her region dissolves. The souls trapped there are released and returned to the sphere, though deeply wounded by their suffering.

Next is the third ruler, Triple-faced Hekatē, who oversees 27 demons. These spirits enter people, causing them to lie, commit perjury, and covet what isn't theirs. The souls she takes are handed over to her demons for punishment—burned in smoke and fire for 105 years and 6 months, gradually being destroyed. When the stars align again—Zeus in Scorpio, Aphrodite in Taurus—Melchisedec gazes from above and her domain dissolves. The souls are released and sent back into the sphere.

The fourth ruler is Parhedrōn Typhōn, a powerful being with 32 demons under his command. His demons tempt people into lust, promiscuity, and constant sexual indulgence. The souls he captures are tormented for 128 years in his fiery realm. But when the divine timing arrives—Zeus in Sagittarius, Aphrodite in Gemini—a mighty being named Zarazaz (also known as Maskelli) looks upon his realm, dissolving it and releasing the imprisoned souls.

The fifth ruler is Yachthanabas, who leads many demons that corrupt justice. These spirits influence people to favor the guilty, accept bribes, and forget the poor, distracting them from their spiritual lives. The souls caught by Yachthanabas suffer for 150 years and 8 months in smoke and fire. When the stars align—Zeus in Aquarius, Aphrodite in Leo—the great Iaō, the Good, looks down from above. Yachthanabas’s realm is destroyed, and the souls are returned to the world.

Jesus concludes, “These are the workings of the Way of the Midst, which you asked me about.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals a vivid map of the soul’s journey through darkness—through spiritual forces that torment and purify. Each ruler of the Midst represents a distorted force in the psyche: Ariouth symbolizes wrath and conflict; Hekatē, deception and greed; Typhōn, uncontrolled lust; Yachthanabas, injustice and forgetfulness of the sacred.

But despite the terrifying imagery, the message is ultimately hopeful: the Light intervenes. Cosmic cycles bring divine attention to these regions of torment. The veils part, a gaze descends, and liberation happens. This is a metaphor for the seasons of awakening that arrive in our lives, dissolving the structures of suffering and returning us to a state where we can try again.

Even the darkest forces do not have the final say. Time, repentance, and divine mercy bring renewal.

### Reflection

* Which of the five inner forces described (rage, deceit, lust, injustice, forgetfulness) do you most need to bring into the Light?
* Can you recall a time when a spiritual or emotional breakthrough “dissolved” a place of torment in you?
* How might you open yourself to divine timing and trust that even the worst inner struggles are not permanent?
