## Chapter 4 — When the Light Returns

The disciples sat together, trembling with fear. The earthquake had shaken them deeply—not just the ground beneath their feet, but something inside them. In their grief and confusion, they began to weep, asking one another, “What’s going to happen now? Will the Savior destroy everything?”

They wept as a group, overwhelmed.

Then, at the ninth hour of the next day, the heavens opened. And they saw Jesus descending once again—this time, shining even more brilliantly than before. The light around him was so intense, no words could describe it. It was greater than any light they had seen when he first ascended. Rays of light poured out from him in every direction—multicolored, multi-layered—some beams more radiant and refined than others. And yet, all of it was one complete and unified light.

This luminous presence had three distinct layers:

* The lowest layer resembled the light that had first enveloped Jesus before he ascended.
* The middle layer was even more refined, more glorious.
* The highest layer shone brightest of all—beyond description.

Each of the three kinds of light was different, each more exquisite than the one before. And yet they were all part of the same single glory.

### What it means

This chapter speaks to the way Divine Light returns to us after upheaval—not in a simple or singular way, but layered, radiant, and beyond what we can fully understand.

The disciples had just experienced a cosmic trembling, and their first reaction was fear. They wondered if everything they knew was about to be undone. But instead of destruction, what came next was revelation. Jesus returned, not with judgment, but with *even greater light* than before.

This mirrors a deep truth: when we descend into fear, grief, or uncertainty, we often feel abandoned or lost. But the spiritual path shows us again and again that Light returns. And when it does, it comes with new dimensions—more nuanced, more integrated, more whole. Like the threefold glory that surrounded Jesus, our own awakening happens in layers. What once felt like confusion or collapse becomes the foundation for something more radiant.

And these layers of light—the lower, the middle, the highest—may reflect our own stages of transformation:

* The first light: an initial glimpse of awakening, a moment of inspiration or peace.
* The second: a deeper clarity, born of struggle and surrender.
* The third: a higher knowing, where the soul recognizes its unity with the Divine.

All these are part of one Light, one unfolding.

### Reflection

* When have you feared that your world was falling apart, only to later find that something greater was emerging?
* Can you identify different “layers” of light or growth in your own life—moments that built upon one another to bring deeper clarity?
* How might the return of Jesus in ever-brightening glory reflect the way your soul continues to receive and embody Divine presence?
