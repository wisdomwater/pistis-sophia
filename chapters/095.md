## Chapter 95 — The Mystery of the Ineffable Is Yours

When Jesus heard what Mary said and saw that the disciples were discouraged, he comforted them:

"Don’t be sad, my disciples, and don’t think that you’re incapable of understanding the mystery of the Ineffable. Truly I tell you: this mystery belongs to you—and to anyone who listens to your words, turns away from this world and its attachments, and lets go of the harmful thoughts and distractions of this age.

So I say again: for anyone who truly renounces the material world and gives themselves over to the Divine, the mystery of the Ineffable is actually simpler and easier to understand than all the other mysteries of the Light realm. It’s more accessible than them all. Whoever grasps the knowledge (gnosis) of this mystery must first turn away from worldly cares.

That’s why I said before: ‘All of you who are weary and burdened, come to me, and I will give you rest. For my burden is easy, and my yoke is light.’ If you receive this mystery, you must let go of all worldly concerns. So don’t be afraid or think you won’t understand. Truly, this mystery is easier to receive than any other—and it is yours, and belongs to all who renounce the world and its illusions.

Now listen closely, my disciples, my companions, and my brothers. I’m ready to begin showing you the full knowledge of the Ineffable. I have now reached the point where I can speak of how the whole universe expanded—because understanding that expansion *is* the knowledge of the mystery.

So, let me begin revealing this step by step.

This mystery understands why the five Helpers separated from one another and emerged from the One-without-Origin.

It knows why the Great Light of lights divided and emerged from the same source.

It knows why the First Command split into seven mysteries, why it was called the First Command, and why it came forth from the One-without-Origin.

It knows why the Great Light of the Impressions of the Light separated itself and stood alone, without sending out further emanations, and why it came forth from the same source.

It understands why the First Mystery—called the twenty-fourth from the outside—divided and shaped itself after twelve mysteries, following the pattern of the uncontainable and boundless, and why it too emerged from the One-without-Origin.

It knows why the Twelve Immoveables divided and formed their structures, and why they emerged from the same source.

It knows why the Unshakables split into twelve orders, and why they came forth from the Fatherless, as part of the structure of the Ineffable.

It understands why the Incomprehensibles of the second space of the Ineffable separated and came into being.

It knows why the Twelve Undesignatables divided themselves after the pattern of the Unindicatables—beings that are uncontainable and boundless—and came from the same origin.

It understands why the Unindicatables themselves split apart, even though they never revealed or made themselves known in the plan of the One and Only, the Ineffable.

It knows why the Super-deeps divided into a single order, and why they came forth from the Fatherless.

It knows why the twelve Unspeakables split into three groups, and why they emerged from the same source.

It understands why all the Imperishables, in their twelve orders, divided and arranged themselves, forming a single order and yet many at once—uncontainable and boundless—and why they came forth.

It knows why the Impassables, forming twelve limitless spaces, organized themselves into three levels according to the plan of the One and Only, and emerged from the Fatherless.

It knows why the Twelve Uncontainables, from the One and Only, emerged and journeyed into the space of the First Mystery, which is the second space.

It knows why the twenty-four myriads of Praise-singers split and placed themselves outside the veil of the First Mystery—who is dual, looking within and without—and why they too came forth.

It knows why all the uncontainable beings of the second space of the Ineffable—including those I’ve just named—expanded and emerged from the Fatherless.

It understands why the twenty-four mysteries of the first Thrice-Spiritual world divided, were called the twenty-four spaces, and emerged from the second Thrice-Spiritual world.

It knows why the twenty-four mysteries of the second Thrice-Spiritual divided and came from the third.

It understands why the twenty-four mysteries of the third Thrice-Spiritual—which is the first from above—split and came from the Fatherless.

It knows why the five Trees of the first Thrice-Spiritual split, arranged themselves one behind another, and interwove all their orders, coming forth from the Fatherless.

It understands the same for the five Trees of the second and third Thrice-Spiritual realms.

It knows why the Fore-Uncontainables of the first, second, and third Thrice-Spiritual split and emerged.

It understands why the first Thrice-Spiritual from below (linked to the One and Only) divided and came from the second Thrice-Spiritual.

It knows why the third Thrice-Spiritual (the first from above) split and came from the twelfth Proto-Thrice-Spiritual, located at the boundary of the Fatherless.

It knows why all the realms within the Ineffable’s space expanded and emerged from the last part—the final limb—of the Ineffable.

And finally, it knows why the mystery itself had to divide and emerge from the Ineffable—the One who governs and expands all things according to their order.

### What it means

This chapter is a powerful reassurance from Jesus. The disciples feel overwhelmed by the vastness of divine mystery, but he comforts them: the mystery of the Ineffable isn’t just for spiritual elites—it belongs to *them*, and to anyone willing to let go of worldly concerns and open to the Divine.

Even more striking, Jesus insists that this mystery is *easier* to understand than all the other heavenly mysteries. Why? Because it isn’t about complicated hierarchies—it’s about surrender. About letting go.

Then, Jesus starts to explain. He reveals that the entire spiritual structure of existence—the divisions, the emanations, the many layered beings and realms—were all expressions of this one great mystery. Everything came forth from the One-without-Origin, the Fatherless. Everything is part of a divine unfolding.

And the mystery itself is aware of all this. It *is* the knowing.

### Reflection

* What do you think it means that the deepest spiritual mystery is “easier” than all the others?
* Are there burdens or worries you might be invited to lay down, in order to receive something deeper?
* How do you relate to the image of all things emanating from a single Source? What feelings does that evoke?
