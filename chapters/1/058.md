## Chapter 58 — The Light Rescues Sophia and Her Song of Praise

Jesus continued teaching his disciples:

After Pistis Sophia finished her thirteenth repentance, the time was fulfilled for her to be lifted from the chaos. On my own initiative—without needing the permission of the First Mystery—I sent a light-power from within myself. I dispatched it into the chaos to help lift Sophia out of the deep regions and bring her to the higher regions of the chaos, where she could wait until the First Mystery granted permission for her complete liberation.

As the light-power led Sophia upward, the emanations of Self-willed noticed her ascent. They chased after her, trying to drag her back into the lower chaos.

But the light-power I had sent shone with brilliant intensity.

As the forces of Self-willed approached, Sophia, now in the higher chaos, sang a song of praise to me:

**Sophia’s Song of Praise**

1. I sing praises to you, O Light, because I longed to return to you. You are my deliverer.

2. Do not abandon me in the chaos. Save me, Light of the Heights, for you are the one I praised.

3. You sent your light directly to me and rescued me. You lifted me to the higher regions of chaos.

4. Let the powers of Self-willed fall back down into the lower chaos. Do not let them see me in this higher region.

5. Let thick darkness and deep gloom cover them so they cannot perceive the light-power you sent to save me. Let them lose their power over me.

6. May the plans they made to steal my power fail. Let the light they tried to take from me be taken from them instead.

7. They planned to rob me of all my light, but failed, because your light-power was with me.

8. They acted without your command, O Light, and so they failed to overpower me.

9. Because I have trusted the Light, I am not afraid. The Light is my rescuer, and I will not fear.

Jesus then invited anyone whose spiritual power was awakened to interpret the meaning of Sophia’s praise.

**Salome Responds**

Salome stepped forward and said:

“My Lord, my inner power compels me to explain these words. Your light-power already spoke of this through Solomon in the *Odes of Solomon*:”

1. I thank you, Lord, for you are my God.

2. Do not abandon me, for you are my hope.

3. You gave me your grace freely, and I am saved by you.

4. Let those who pursue me fall away and not be able to see me.

5. May smoke and mist cloud their vision, so they cannot seize me.

6. May their plans be powerless, and their schemes fall back on them.

7. They formed a plan, but it failed.

8. Though they seemed strong, they were defeated, and their evil plans collapsed.

9. My hope is in the Lord. I will not be afraid, for you are my God and my Savior.

Jesus said to her, “Well said, Salome. Beautifully spoken. That is the true interpretation of Sophia’s words.”

### What it means

Sophia’s journey is reaching a turning point. After her deep repentance, Jesus sends a light-power—a divine spark from himself—to lift her closer to her original place. Although the dark forces still try to pull her back, she is now protected and begins to praise the Light with confidence and joy.

Her praise is not just worship—it’s a testimony of rescue. She acknowledges how the Light saved her and confesses that even though the forces of darkness tried to destroy her, they could not succeed because they acted without divine permission.

Salome interprets Sophia’s praise using words from the *Odes of Solomon*, showing how divine hope and protection have always been part of the spiritual tradition. Sophia is no longer just crying out in desperation—she is now affirming her trust in the Light.

### Reflection

* Sophia is no longer asking for salvation; she’s praising the Light for saving her. What does this shift from desperation to gratitude reveal about spiritual transformation?
* She names the “lion-faced power” and “Self-willed” as sources of oppression. What are the forces in your own life that try to reclaim you after you've grown or healed?
* Salome, another woman, steps forward with deep spiritual insight. What does this say about the feminine voice in the journey toward divine understanding?
