# Chapter 44 — The Sixth Repentance: Trusting the Light in Darkness

When Jesus heard Philip speak, he responded warmly, saying: “Well said, Philip, my beloved. Come now, take your place and write down your share of everything I say, everything I do, and all that you witness.”

Philip then took his seat and began to write.

Jesus continued his teaching, saying to his disciples:

Then Pistis Sophia cried out once more to the Light. The Light forgave her for turning away from her proper place and descending into the darkness. She offered her sixth repentance, praying:

1. I have sung praises to you, O Light, even while I was trapped in the darkness below.

2. Listen to my repentance. Let your Light hear my voice as I cry out to you.

3. O Light, if you hold my sin against me, I won’t be able to stand in your presence. You would turn away from me.

4. But you, O Light, are my Savior. I have put my trust in you because your name shines with Light.

5. The strength within me has trusted in your mystery. Even when I was among the heights, I trusted in the Light, and even now, in this chaotic darkness, I still do.

6. May every part of me trust in the Light, even while I remain in this darkness. And may that trust be restored when I return to the heights.

7. It is the Light that shows mercy and sets us free. In it is a great and powerful mystery of salvation.

8. And it will save every part of me that has been lost in the chaos, because of my fall. I left my true home and descended into the chaos.

Now, let anyone with a lifted mind, anyone with insight, understand.

## What it means

This chapter is a sacred moment of restoration. Jesus affirms Philip’s role as a witness and recorder, showing us how important it is to have those who document and preserve the wisdom of the soul’s journey.

But the heart of the chapter is Sophia’s sixth repentance—a prayer of praise, trust, and surrender from within the depths of her darkness. Her words show us the way back when we have fallen far. She does not deny her descent into chaos but uses it as a place to renew her faith in the Light.

Sophia represents the soul in all of us—the part that longs for truth, makes mistakes, and yet still sings in the dark. Her repeated trust in the Light, even when she cannot see it, is an act of profound inner strength. The Light, in turn, is not an external force, but the Divine Source within that responds to our longing with mercy and healing.

The “powers” in her can be seen as the different faculties of the human psyche—mind, heart, will, intuition—all of which must learn to trust the Light again, even when lost in confusion or pain. Her plea is not for punishment to be lifted but for trust to be restored. It is the process of reintegrating the soul through repentance and love.

In the end, the call is for the “exalted mind” to understand. This is a mystical nudge toward inner wisdom: only when we rise above our limited thinking can we grasp the beauty of this redemptive journey.

## Reflection

* When have you found yourself “singing in the dark,” offering praise or trust even when you felt lost?
* What parts of you—thoughts, emotions, desires—need to learn to trust the Light again?
* How do you respond to the idea that Divine Light is most present when we feel furthest from it?
