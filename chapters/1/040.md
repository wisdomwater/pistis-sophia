## Chapter 40 — John Explains the Fourth Repentance

While Jesus was speaking to his disciples about the fourth repentance that Pistis Sophia had expressed, John stepped forward, respectfully placing his head on Jesus’ chest. He asked Jesus for permission to explain the meaning of this repentance.

Jesus gave John the permission to speak.

John then began to explain, drawing from Psalm 101, which had been inspired long ago by the light and power within David. He quoted the psalm as a way to interpret the deep sorrow and hope behind Pistis Sophia’s repentance:

1. Lord, please hear my prayer and listen to my cry.  

2. Don’t turn away from me; be near when I’m overwhelmed. Quickly listen when I call out.  

3. My days feel like smoke disappearing; my bones feel dry and worn.  

4. I am like burnt grass; my heart is dried out because I’ve forgotten to care for myself.  

5. My groaning is so deep my bones stick to my flesh.  

6. I feel alone like a pelican in the desert or a lonely owl in an empty house.  

7. I have stayed awake all night, feeling like a lone sparrow on a rooftop.  

8. My enemies insult me constantly, and even those who should honor me hurt me.  

9. I have eaten ashes instead of food and mixed my drink with tears.  

10. Because of your anger, you have lifted me up and then thrown me down.  

11. My life passes like a shadow; I feel dried up like grass.  

12. But you, Lord, remain forever, and your memory lasts through all generations.  

13. Rise up and show mercy to Zion—now is the time to have compassion.  

14. Your servants long for her stones and will care for her land.  

15. The nations will respect the name of the Lord, and the kings of the earth will fear your power.  

16. The Lord will rebuild Zion and reveal his sovereign glory.  

17. He has heard the prayers of the humble and not ignored their cries.  

18. This will be remembered for future generations, and those yet to be born will praise the Lord.  

19. The Lord looks down from heaven to the earth,  

20. To hear the sighs of those in chains and free those who have been killed,  

21. To proclaim his name in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem.

John concluded, “This is the meaning behind the repentance that Pistis Sophia has expressed.”

### What it means

This chapter uses the language of a heartfelt psalm to express deep inner suffering, isolation, and spiritual longing. Pistis Sophia’s repentance reflects the soul’s experience when it feels lost, forgotten, or punished by the very divine light it seeks. The imagery of dryness, loneliness, and despair mirrors our psychological states when disconnected from inner nourishment and love.

Yet, amid this suffering, there is a turning point: a call for mercy, renewal, and restoration. The psalm reminds us that even in our darkest moments, the divine is always present, listening, and ready to rebuild and restore the soul’s connection to its true home.

This chapter invites the reader to recognize and honor the painful parts of the self that feel abandoned or broken. Spiritually, it encourages trust in divine mercy and the promise of transformation. This repentance is not about punishment, but about awakening to the need for healing and the hope of renewal.

### Reflection

* When have you felt like the “dry grass” or the “lonely sparrow” in your own life? How did you cope with those feelings?  
* What does mercy mean to you, both in terms of giving it to yourself and receiving it from a higher power?  
* How can you hold hope for renewal and transformation even when you feel overwhelmed by despair?
