## Chapter 22 — A Question of Mercy

After Jesus finished speaking, Philip—who had been carefully writing down every word—stepped forward. He fell at Jesus’ feet in reverence and said:

“My Lord and Savior, please allow me to ask something before you begin to speak about the places you went during your ministry.”

Jesus, full of compassion, answered:
“You are free to speak, Philip. Say what is on your heart.”

Philip said:
“My Lord, why have you changed the powers of the rulers—their influence, their fate, their spheres, their entire domain? Why have you thrown them into confusion and caused them to lose their way? Was this done for the salvation of the world, or was it for some other purpose?”

### What it means

This chapter opens a tender moment of devotion and inquiry. Philip is not only writing down the words of Jesus—he’s listening deeply, reverently, seeking the meaning behind the actions of his Master. His question is one of profound love: *Was all this for the sake of the world?*

Philip is asking whether the great cosmic reordering—the breaking of celestial bonds, the disruption of spiritual powers—was an act of judgment or an act of salvation.

And the implication in the way he asks is clear: *He hopes it was mercy.*

In this, Philip becomes a symbol of the seeking soul—one that is not satisfied with surface answers, but longs to understand the heart of God. His reverence, his careful listening, and his humble question show us how to come before the Mystery: not with control or pride, but with awe and love.

Jesus’ response, simple and open, grants Philip permission: *“Authority is given to you to speak.”* This is the way of divine love—it invites us into dialogue, into participation. We are not merely observers of God’s work in the cosmos; we are invited into its meaning.

### Reflection

* Have you believed that God's disruptions in your life were punishment—or can you trust that they might be acts of salvation?
* When things fall apart, when the stars no longer tell their stories as they once did — can you believe that it is for the healing of the world?
* What in you needs to fall down before the feet of Jesus and ask: *Was this all done for love?*
