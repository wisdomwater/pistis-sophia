## Chapter 6 — Now I Will Speak to You Face to Face

When the disciples heard Jesus speak, they cried out:

“Lord, if it is really you, please draw back your radiant light—it's too much for us. We can’t see. Our eyes are overwhelmed, and the whole world seems to be shaking because of the light around you.”

Then Jesus gently pulled the intensity of his glory back into himself. When he did, the disciples were able to calm down. They came close to him, fell at his feet in reverence, and were filled with joy.

They said:
“Teacher, where did you go? What was your mission? Why did the earth shake and everything become so disturbed?”

Then Jesus, full of compassion, answered them:

“Rejoice. From now on, I will speak to you openly. I have returned to the realms from which I came, and from this moment forward, I will no longer speak in riddles or symbols. I will tell you everything—openly and directly—from the beginning to the end of all truth. Nothing will be hidden anymore. I have been given the authority, through the Unnameable Source and the First Mystery, to reveal everything—from the innermost to the outermost. So listen carefully.”

And he continued:

“While I sat apart from you on the Mount of Olives, I was reflecting on the mission I had been sent to complete. I saw that my work on Earth was finished. But one thing remained: the final mystery—the twenty-fourth mystery—had not yet returned my radiant robe, the divine garment I had left behind until the right moment. As I waited for it, I sat in silence, contemplating all of this.”

### What it means

This chapter is about the shift from hidden to revealed, from mystery to understanding.

At first, the disciples can’t handle the full presence of Divine Light—it overwhelms them, like too much truth or too much love all at once. So Jesus, in compassion, tempers the light, meeting them where they are.

There’s something deeply personal in this. Sometimes we, too, feel like the truth is too much, too bright, too fast. And like Jesus here, the Divine doesn’t push us beyond what we can bear—it meets us with gentleness.

But then something powerful happens. Jesus promises to speak plainly now. The time for symbols is ending. The veils are thinning. The journey has reached a turning point—truth will no longer be hidden.

This signals the soul’s readiness. After fear gives way to trust, deeper wisdom can be received—not just in symbols or sacred stories, but *directly.*

### Reflection

* Have you ever experienced a moment when clarity emerged from confusion—when something that felt overwhelming suddenly made sense?
* What parts of your spiritual journey feel like “too much light” right now? What might it look like to ask the Divine to meet you gently there?
* What does it mean to you to hear, “From this moment, I will speak to you face to face”?
