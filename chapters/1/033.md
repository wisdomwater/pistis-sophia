## Chapter 33 — The First Cry for Help

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, he said to them: “This is the song of praise that Pistis Sophia sang in her first moment of repentance. She was grieving over her mistake and told the story of what had happened to her. So now, let anyone who has ears, listen closely.”

Mary stepped forward again and said, “My Lord, the light within me hears you. Your Spirit that is with me has brought me clarity. Let me share what Pistis Sophia said in her repentance, as she spoke of her sin and everything she endured. Your divine power had already spoken about this long ago through the prophet David in Psalm 68:

1. Save me, O God, for I am drowning in deep waters.

2. I’m sinking in the mud of the abyss—I have no strength. I’ve been pulled into the sea’s depths; a storm has overtaken me.

3. I’ve cried so long, my voice is gone; my eyes are failing from waiting so long for You.

4. My enemies, who hate me for no reason, are too many to count. Powerful ones attack me and demand things I never stole.

5. God, You know my foolishness. My failings aren’t hidden from You.

6. Don’t let those who trust in You be ashamed because of me. Don’t let seekers of You lose heart, O Lord of all.

7. Because of You, I’ve suffered shame; my face burns with humiliation.

8. I feel like a stranger to my own family.

9. I’ve been consumed with passion for Your house. The insults thrown at You have fallen on me.

10. I humbled myself with fasting, and people mocked me for it.

11. I wore sackcloth, and I became a joke to them.

12. The people at the city gates gossip about me, and the drunkards sing songs mocking me.

13. But I keep praying to You, Lord. Now is the time for You to show kindness. Answer me with Your faithful love.

14. Pull me out of this mud so I don’t sink. Save me from those who hate me, from drowning in these deep waters.

15. Don’t let the flood overwhelm me, don’t let the abyss swallow me, don’t let the pit close over me.

16. Listen to me, Lord, because Your love is good. Look on me with compassion.

17. Don’t turn away. I’m in trouble—hear me fast!

18. Come close and rescue me. Save me from my enemies.

19. You see my shame and dishonor. You know how I’m mistreated.

20. My heart is crushed. I hoped someone would care, but no one came. I looked for comfort, but found none.

21. They gave me bitter gall for food, and vinegar to quench my thirst.

22. Let their feasts become traps, and what should have been joy become their downfall.

23. May their backs always be burdened.

24. Pour out Your anger on them. Let Your wrath overtake them.

25. Leave their homes empty, with no one left to dwell in them.

26. For they attacked the one You wounded, adding more pain to his suffering.

27. They kept piling on their wrongdoing. Don’t let them be counted among the just.

28. Erase their names from the book of life. Don’t let them be written among the righteous.

29. But I am crushed and hurting. Let Your saving presence gather me up.

30. I will praise God’s name with a song, and lift Him up in thanksgiving.

31. This will delight God more than any ritual offering.

32. Let the poor see this and rejoice. Seek God, and your hearts will live.

33. For God hears the brokenhearted and does not despise the imprisoned.

34. Let all creation—heaven, earth, and sea—praise the Lord.

35. For God will save Zion and rebuild Judah’s cities. His people will live and inherit the land.

36. The children of His servants will dwell there, and those who love Him will make it their home.

### What it means

This chapter shows Pistis Sophia in a state of deep sorrow, regret, and desperation. She realizes how far she has fallen from the Light and begins her journey back by crying out for help. Her words, drawn from Psalm 68, reflect someone overwhelmed by emotional and spiritual chaos—drowning in shame, guilt, and rejection. And yet, in the midst of this, she doesn’t give up. She continues to call out to the Divine.

Symbolically, Sophia represents the human soul when it has turned away from its Source and realizes its mistake. Her pain is universal—the pain of anyone who has been lost, misunderstood, or abandoned. But she also reveals a deeper truth: that even when we feel the farthest from God, our longing and willingness to return are powerful. She teaches that divine compassion does not reject our cries, even if they come from the depths of darkness.

Psychologically, this is the beginning of inner transformation. It’s the moment we see ourselves clearly, not with shame but with the humility that leads to healing. It is also a recognition that the systems of the world often add pain to our wounds—but divine Love invites us back with mercy, not condemnation.

### Reflection

* When have you felt like you were “drowning” emotionally or spiritually? What helped you cry out?
* Are there parts of your past that still carry shame? What would it mean to let divine compassion reach those places?
* What voices in your life echo the mockery and rejection Sophia felt—and how might you listen instead for the voice of the Light within?
