# Chapter 26 — The Dimming of False Power and the Resistance to Release

This cycle of purification kept happening over and over—until eventually, the cosmic rulers began to lose their strength. Their power diminished, they grew weak and drained, and the light that sustained their realm faded. As their light vanished, their kingdoms started to collapse, and the universe began to rise up and evolve.

When the rulers realized what was happening, and when the time aligned again with Melchizedek—the Receiver of the Light—he came once more into their midst. He stirred them up again, throwing their systems into chaos. They were forced to abandon their rigid paths and patterns. In their distress, they released their power once more—through their breath, their tears, and their sweat.

As always, Melchizedek purified this light and brought it into the Treasury of the Light. But this time, the rulers of the aeons, fate, and the spheres panicked. They turned to the leftover material—their refuse—and tried to consume it themselves. They didn't want to let that matter go and become souls in the world.

Why? Because if they released it, they would grow even weaker. Their power would continue to fade, their influence would crumble, and their kingdoms would collapse. So, instead, they clung to that material in an attempt to delay the inevitable—for as long as possible—until the full number of perfected souls had been gathered into the Treasury of the Light.

## What it means

This chapter illustrates the desperate clinging of false systems of power—both cosmic and psychological—when they realize their time is running out. The rulers (symbolizing ego patterns, internal tyrants, or oppressive systems) are losing their hold because the light is being reclaimed. As awakening and purification happen, their energy wanes.

But instead of surrendering, these forces resist. They try to keep what little power remains by holding onto the very substance they previously discarded. They devour the refuse—the unconscious material, the trauma, the habits—trying to keep it from becoming something new and whole (like a soul). They fear transformation because it means the end of their dominance.

Melchizedek’s role is again crucial: he stirs, disrupts, and purifies. He is the divine force that destabilizes what is stagnant and awakens what is divine. His work continues until all the perfected souls—the awakened, healed, and luminous beings—are gathered into the Treasury of the Light.

This is a reminder that awakening is not always peaceful at first. There is often agitation and resistance. Old patterns may fight to survive. But the light is stronger, and it is destined to return to its source.

## Reflection

* What parts of you are clinging to old ways of being, even though they are no longer life-giving?
* How do you respond when inner change feels disruptive or chaotic—do you resist or allow the transformation?
* In what ways can you support the return of light within yourself, even when it means letting go of control?
