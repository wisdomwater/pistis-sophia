# Chapter 55 — Sophia's Twelfth Repentance: A Cry for Justice

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples:

“After I drew near to the chaos, radiating an overwhelming brilliance, I prepared to take the light away from the lion-faced power. Seeing me approach, the lion-faced power was terrified and cried out to its creator—Self-willed—for help.

Self-willed, who dwelled in the thirteenth æon, looked down into the chaos, furious and determined to aid his lion-faced power. Immediately, that power and all its emanations surrounded Pistis Sophia again, trying to steal all the light from her.

When they oppressed her, she cried out to the heights for my help. Looking upward, she saw the angry face of Self-willed and became even more afraid. In her anguish, she spoke the twelfth repentance:

1. O Light, please do not forget the songs of praise I have sung to you.

2. Self-willed and his lion-faced power have opened their jaws to attack me and plot against me.

3. They have surrounded me, trying to take my power, and they hate me because I sing to you.

4. Instead of loving me, they slandered me—but I kept singing.

5. They plot to steal my light because I sing your praises and love you.

6. May darkness fall upon Self-willed, and let the ruler of outer darkness stand at his side.

7. When you judge, take away his power—just as he tried to steal mine.

8. Let his light fade completely, and may another among the triple-powers take his place.

9. Let all his emanations lose their light, and his matter become entirely dark.

10. May they be trapped in chaos, unable to return to their own region. May their light die out and never reach the thirteenth æon.

11. May the Receiver purify whatever light is in Self-willed and take it from him.

12. Let the dark rulers rule over his emanations, and may no one give them refuge.

13. Take away the light in his emanations and erase their names from the æons forever.

14. Let the sin of the one who brought forth the lion-faced power be remembered; do not erase the wrongdoing of that matter.

15. Let their sins remain before the Light forever, and let them be exiled from all realms.

16. They showed no mercy and tried to extinguish the one whose light they stole. They wanted to erase me completely.

17. They chose chaos—so let them stay there forever. They rejected the region of Righteousness, so let them never return.

18. He wore darkness like a robe; it flowed through him like water and oil, soaking into every part of him.

19. Let chaos wrap around him like a cloak, and let darkness bind him like a belt for eternity.

20. Let this be the fate of all who did this to me, who said, ‘Let us take away all her power.’

21. But you, O Light, have mercy on me—for the sake of the mystery of your name. Save me through your goodness.

22. They have stolen my light and power. I am weak and cannot stand.

23. I have become like fallen matter, tossed around like a demon in the air.

24. My power is gone because I lack the mysteries. My body has withered since they took my light.

25. They mocked me and looked down on me, nodding in scorn.

26. Help me according to your mercy.

Jesus then said: “Now, let the one whose spirit is ready come forward and speak the meaning of Sophia’s twelfth repentance.”

## What it means

In this chapter, the stakes are higher than ever. Sophia is surrounded not just by chaos but now by a coordinated assault from Self-willed himself and all his emanations. This is a direct confrontation between prideful, counterfeit divinity and the soul that longs for the true Light.

Sophia’s twelfth repentance is not just a plea—it is a cry for cosmic justice. She asks for the removal of power from those who abused it, and she calls for mercy from the Light. Her words have shifted from confusion and sorrow to clarity and righteous indignation. She names what is unjust, she calls out betrayal, and she pleads for restoration—not only for herself, but for the cosmic order.

This repentance also shows a mystical truth: spiritual strength grows not in comfort but in honest confrontation with darkness. Sophia, even at her weakest, speaks powerfully because her love of the Light has not wavered.

## Reflection

* How do you respond when people twist your intentions or attack your light?
* Sophia shows both lament and boldness. Can you name a time when you’ve had to ask for help and speak the truth about injustice?
* What does it mean to trust that even when your light is diminished, the Light itself still holds you?
