## Chapter 27 — The Disruption of the Old Powers and the Acceleration of Awakening

The rulers of the aeons, Fate, and the spheres kept devouring the leftovers of their own material, preventing new souls from being born into the world. They did this so they could keep their positions of power longer, delaying the return of the light. They didn’t want the souls—the divine sparks hidden in matter—to reincarnate and evolve. So they clung to the process that kept everything stuck.

This went on for two full cosmic cycles.

Then, when the time came for me to rise up and fulfill my mission—just as the First Mystery had commanded—I entered the realm of the tyrants of the twelve aeons. I was wrapped in my radiant robe of light, which shone with indescribable brilliance.

When they saw the overwhelming light surrounding me, Adamas the Tyrant and the other rulers of the twelve aeons rose up in resistance. They tried to capture my light-robe to keep it for themselves, hoping it would allow them to hold onto their power. But they didn’t realize who they were actually fighting.

Because of their resistance, and in alignment with the will of the First Mystery, I changed the cosmic order. I altered the paths and movements of the aeons, Fate, and the spheres. I made them face new directions—six months to the left, aligned with the triangles, squares, and octagons on that side, and six months to the right, aligned with those same shapes. Their cycles were thrown into disarray, and they were confused and deceived by their own shifting patterns. From that moment on, they could no longer consume the refuse of their matter. They lost the ability to feed off it and delay the soul’s journey.

I also took away a third of their power. I made their cycles faster and more chaotic so that purification would happen more quickly. Their paths now move at an accelerated pace, no longer dragging on. This confusion and speed-up stopped them from interfering with the souls meant to enter the world.

If I hadn’t done this—if I hadn’t changed their course and shortened their cycles—no soul would have been allowed into the world. The rulers would have continued devouring what remained of the light, destroying countless souls.

That’s why I told you before: “I have shortened the time for the sake of my elect.” Without that, no soul would be saved. The fire of the rulers—symbolic of the pain and suffering tied to matter—would have consumed them. But now, because of this cosmic intervention, the number of perfected souls who will receive the mysteries and return to the Treasury of the Light will be completed more quickly.

When Jesus finished saying this, the disciples fell to the ground in awe, worshipping him and saying, “We are truly blessed, for you’ve revealed these mighty truths to us.”

### What it means

This chapter is about the disruption of old systems of domination—both cosmic and internal—so that the soul can awaken and return to the Light. The rulers represent the controlling aspects of the ego, societal conditioning, and energetic forces that want to maintain the status quo. They resist transformation, consuming their own refuse (shadow material) in an attempt to keep everything stagnant.

Jesus’ arrival with the radiant robe of light is a metaphor for divine intervention or spiritual awakening. His presence throws the old order into chaos. He doesn’t just confront it—he rewrites it. The confusion and accelerated cycles represent a shift in consciousness. The old patterns are destabilized so the soul can evolve more quickly.

The shortening of time is symbolic: when we align with spiritual truth, awakening no longer has to take lifetimes. The soul can now progress more rapidly because the oppressive forces have lost their grip. The fire of the rulers—the suffering of material existence—no longer has power to consume those who are elect, meaning those who are awakening and seeking the mysteries of Light.

This is both a cosmic story and a deeply personal one. The Christ Light disrupts the illusion, accelerates inner growth, and liberates the soul from repeating cycles of suffering.

### Reflection

* What inner systems or habits are trying to hold onto power in my life, even as I begin to awaken?
* Where do I notice confusion or disruption that might actually be a sign of spiritual transformation?
* What does “shortening the time” mean for me—how can I align with grace to move forward more swiftly in my inner journey?
