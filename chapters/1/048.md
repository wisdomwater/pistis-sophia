# Chapter 48 — The Return of Opposition and the Cry for Rescue

When Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples, he continued and said:

“It happened that the lion-faced power noticed that Pistis Sophia had still not been fully lifted out of the chaos. So it returned once more, bringing with it all the material emanations of Self-Willed, and together they oppressed her again. In the midst of this renewed attack, she cried out in repentance, saying:

9. ‘Have mercy on me, O Light, for they are attacking me again. Because of your command, the light within me is confused, and both my strength and understanding are weakened.

10. My power is fading while I remain in these sufferings, and the time I spend in this chaos is dragging on. My light has grown dim, because they have stolen my strength, and all the forces within me are thrown into disorder.

11. I am powerless before all the rulers of the aeons—they hate me. Even the twenty-four emanations, in whose region I once belonged, now reject me. And my brother, my counterpart, was afraid to help me because of what they have done to me.

12. All the rulers of the heights have judged me to be nothing more than matter, something with no light in it. I’ve become like a fallen material force, cast out from among the rulers.

13. Everyone in the aeons said: ‘She has become chaos.’ Then all the merciless powers surrounded me, planning to take away all the light that remains in me.

14. But I have put my trust in you, O Light. I said: ‘You are my Savior.’

15. The mission you gave me—your command for my soul—is in your hands. Save me from the grip of the emanations of Self-Willed, who are oppressing and persecuting me.

16. Shine your light over me, for I am nothing before you. Rescue me through your compassion.

17. Don’t let me be rejected, for I have sung praises to you, O Light. Let the emanations of Self-Willed be swallowed by chaos. Let them be dragged down into the shadows.

18. Silence the mouths of those who want to consume me with lies—those who say, ‘Let’s steal all the light she has,’ even though I’ve done them no harm.’”

## What it means

This chapter is a deep reflection of the human soul’s struggle with relapse, shame, and resistance. Even after beginning the journey of spiritual healing, old patterns—symbolized by the lion-faced power and the emanations of Self-Willed—can rise again to drag us back into confusion and despair.

Pistis Sophia’s words, numbered here as verses of repentance, are like a psalm of the soul under siege. Each cry expresses a different facet of spiritual exhaustion: confusion, weakness, abandonment, judgment, and betrayal. Yet each verse also points to a sacred turning. Despite being judged as “chaos” by those around her—even by those closest to her—Sophia does not surrender to despair. She trusts the Light. She affirms that her destiny, her healing, and her salvation remain in the hands of the Divine.

The chapter mirrors the way our own inner critics and egoic defenses rise up when we are most vulnerable. The “rulers of the aeons” can be seen as inner voices of judgment, and the “emanations of Self-Willed” as our pride, shame, and fear. These inner forces often activate when we are close to a breakthrough, trying to pull us back into the old identity.

This is an invitation to cry out to the Light in our moments of deepest darkness. It’s a reminder that being surrounded by chaos does not define us; what defines us is the trust we place in something higher. The Light remains faithful, even when everything else falls away.

* Have you ever felt judged or abandoned when you were already struggling? How did you keep your connection to the Light?
* What might it look like for you to trust the Divine with your healing, even when you feel “as naught”?
