## Chapter 57 — Sophia's Thirteenth Repentance and Martha's Interpretation

Jesus continued teaching his disciples and said:

After completing the twelve repentances, Pistis Sophia cried out to me again:

**Sophia’s Confession:**

“O Light of lights, I have sinned in the twelve aeons and descended from them. For this reason, I have offered twelve repentances—one for each aeon I abandoned. Now, O Light of lights, please forgive me. My sin is very great because I left the high heavenly realms and chose to dwell in the chaos below.”

**The Thirteenth Repentance of Sophia:**

1. Hear me, O Light of lights, as I sing praises to you. Hear my repentance for the thirteenth aeon—the place I came from—so that the repentance for this aeon may also be fulfilled.
2. Hear my praises from within the thirteenth aeon, my original region.
3. Save me, O Light, by your great mystery. Forgive me through your infinite mercy.
4. Give me the baptism of purification. Cleanse me from all my sins and transgressions.
5. My greatest sin—the cause of my fall—is the lion-faced power. This sin cannot be hidden from you. It brought me down.
6. Among all the invisible ones where I once belonged, I alone have transgressed and descended into chaos. But I did this so that your divine plan might be fulfilled.

After Sophia spoke, Jesus invited anyone whose spirit was moved to interpret her words.

**Martha Responds:**

Martha stepped forward and said:
“My Lord, I feel moved to share the meaning of Sophia’s words. Your light-power already prophesied this through David in Psalm 50 (modern Psalm 51):”

1. Be gracious to me, O God, according to your great mercy; in your abundant compassion, erase my sins.
2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.
3. My sin is always visible before you.
4. So that you are proved right in your words and just in your judgment.

Jesus replied to her, “Well said, Martha. That was beautifully spoken. You are blessed.”

### What it means

Sophia now enters a deeper stage of her return to the Light. After twelve repentances—each tied to a specific aeon or level of descent—she offers a thirteenth. This final repentance acknowledges not just her individual misstep but her cosmic role in allowing the divine plan to unfold.

She confesses that her fall was not random or meaningless. It was painful and caused by pride (symbolized by the lion-faced power), but through it, the divine mystery could be fulfilled. Her cry for baptism and cleansing signifies the turning point: she is no longer simply crying from pain, but actively asking to be restored.

Martha’s interpretation links Sophia’s repentance with Psalm 50 (51)—a famous psalm of deep, heartfelt remorse. It shows that even in ancient scripture, the cry of a soul longing for purification and return was heard and honored.

Jesus blesses Martha’s interpretation, affirming that true spiritual insight is available to those whose spirits are awakened.

### Reflection

* Sophia admits that her fall was both personal and part of a divine plan. Have you ever felt that your deepest mistakes were somehow used for something greater?
* The lion-faced power symbolizes pride or rebellion. What is your “lion-faced power”—the force that draws you away from Light?
* Sophia asks not only for forgiveness but also for baptism—a full renewal. What would spiritual cleansing look like in your own life?
