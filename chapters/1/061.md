## Chapter 61 — The Spirit, the Body, and the Mystery of Oneness

When Jesus heard Mary Magdalene’s words, he praised her: “Well said, Mary, blessed one—you will inherit the entire Kingdom of Light.”

Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, came forward and said, “My Lord and Savior, may I also speak about this mystery?”

Jesus replied, “Anyone whose spirit carries understanding is not only allowed, but encouraged to speak. So yes, Mary—my mother according to the flesh, the one in whom I dwelled—speak the thoughts that move your heart.”

Mary, the mother, continued: “Lord, I will also speak about the words your power spoke through David:

‘Grace and truth met together; righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprang up from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.’

This prophecy was truly about you.

When you were still a child and before the spirit had come fully upon you, something remarkable happened. You were in the vineyard with Joseph, and I was at home. A spirit, looking exactly like you, appeared in my house. I didn’t know who he was, and I thought perhaps he was you—but different somehow. The spirit said to me, ‘Where is Jesus, my brother, so I can meet him?’

I was confused and suspected it was a test or an illusion. So I tied the spirit to the foot of my bed and then ran out to find you and Joseph. I found you working in the vineyard, and when I spoke to Joseph about what had happened, you suddenly understood. You were excited and said, ‘Where is he? I want to see him! Or I will wait here for him.’

When Joseph heard you, he was amazed. We all returned to the house and found the spirit still tied to the bed. You and he looked exactly the same. Then he was untied, embraced you, and kissed you—and you kissed him. The two of you became one.

This is what the Psalm was referring to. ‘Grace’ is the spirit that came down from the First Mystery to have mercy on humanity and to forgive sins, offering the mysteries so that people may inherit the Kingdom of Light. ‘Truth’ is the power that lived in me, and when it came forth from Barbēlō, it took on your material body and proclaimed the truth to the world. ‘Righteousness’ is your divine spirit that brought the hidden mysteries from above to share with humanity. And ‘peace’ is the power that lived within your earthly body—it baptized humanity, helping them turn away from sin and be reconciled with your spirit and the Light.

So when the scripture says, ‘Grace and truth kissed,’ it speaks of this union. ‘Truth sprang up from the earth’—this is your physical body, which came from me and revealed the truth. ‘Righteousness looked down from heaven’—this is the divine power from above that gives the Light’s mysteries so that humanity might become righteous and inherit the Light-Kingdom.”

When Jesus heard this, he said, “Well said, Mary.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals the mysterious union of divine and human within Jesus—and by extension, within each of us. Mary the mother offers a powerful testimony: the spirit that descended from the heights to redeem humanity met and united with the earthly body born through her. They “kissed”—a symbol of complete harmony and integration. 

Grace, truth, righteousness, and peace are not just abstract virtues. They are living powers that move through heaven and earth to bring about unity. The earthly body of Jesus (truth sprung from the earth) and the heavenly spirit (righteousness from above) are brought together not as separate beings, but as two aspects of the same divine-human mystery.

The story of the spirit double—a lookalike of Jesus—hints at the union between our higher self and our embodied self. This “phantom” is not an illusion, but the part of us that descends to remind us who we truly are. The recognition and joyful reunion between Jesus and the spirit symbolizes the awakening of divine identity within us. We are not merely flesh or spirit—we are both, meant to become one in Light.

### Reflection

* Have you ever sensed a deeper, higher part of yourself reaching out to meet the “you” living everyday life?
* How do grace, truth, righteousness, and peace show up in your own journey toward inner wholeness?
* What would it mean for you to embrace both your earthly body and divine spirit as parts of a sacred union?
