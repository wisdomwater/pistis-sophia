## Chapter 5 — It Is I. Do Not Be Afraid.

When the disciples saw Jesus in his dazzling light, they were overwhelmed with fear and confusion. The brilliance was more than they could take in, and their hearts trembled.

But Jesus, full of compassion and tenderness, saw their distress. And he spoke to them gently:

*“Take courage. It is I. Do not be afraid.”*

### What it means

This chapter may be short, but it is profound. In a moment of overwhelming awe and fear, Jesus meets his disciples with the simplest, most healing words: *“It is I.”*

Notice he doesn’t explain the light or the earthquake or the mystery. He doesn’t give them a lesson. He gives them presence.

This is the essence of Divine compassion—it meets us not with grand theories, but with presence and reassurance. The Light may be dazzling, the transformation intense, the path bewildering—but in the heart of it, the Divine speaks: *“It’s me. Don’t be afraid.”*

This is a voice that echoes into our own moments of overwhelm—when life feels too much, when awakening is disorienting, when change shakes the ground beneath us. The voice of love says:
*“Take courage. I’m here. You’re not alone.”*

And that voice—still, calm, radiant—is sometimes all we need to steady ourselves and take the next step.

* How does it feel to imagine the Divine saying to you, *“It is I. Do not be afraid”?*
* What would it mean for you to take courage right now in your life?
