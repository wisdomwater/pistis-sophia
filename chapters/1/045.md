# Chapter 45 — The Judgment of the False Powers and the Restoration of Light

When Jesus had finished speaking, he asked his disciples, “Do you understand the way I speak with you?”

Andrew stepped forward and replied, “Lord, your light-power prophesied this sixth repentance of Pistis Sophia long ago through David in Psalm 129, where it is written:

1. From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord.
2. Hear my voice; let your ears listen to my plea.
3. If you kept a record of our sins, Lord, who could stand?
4. But you offer forgiveness; this is why I wait for you.
5. My soul waits for your word.
6. My soul hopes in you from morning to night. Let all of Israel hope in the Lord, from dawn until dusk.
7. For grace dwells with the Lord, and with Him is great redemption.
8. He will rescue Israel from all their sins.”

Jesus said to Andrew, “Well spoken, Andrew, blessed one. This truly is the interpretation of her repentance. Truly, I tell you: I will perfect you in all the mysteries of the Light and in every level of divine knowledge—from the innermost to the outermost realms, from the most hidden source to the darkest matter, from the highest Light to the lowest depths, from the realm of gods down to demons, from lords down to their subordinates, from human beings to animals and creeping things—so that you may be called ‘perfected ones,’ filled with divine fullness.

Truly, I say to you: In the place where I will dwell in the Kingdom of my Father, you will also be with me. And when the appointed number is complete, and the mixture of Light and darkness is finally undone, I will command that all tyrant gods—those who refuse to surrender the Light within them—be brought forth. I will command the wise fire, which the perfected have already passed through, to consume these tyrants until they release every last trace of Light they still hold.”

Then Jesus asked again, “Do you understand the way I speak to you?”

Mary answered, “Yes, Lord. I understand. When the whole mixture is undone, you will sit on your throne of Light, and we—your disciples—will sit with you on your right. Then you will judge the false gods who have refused to surrender their Light, and the wise fire will consume them until the last spark is released. Concerning this, your Light-power spoke long ago through David in Psalm 82:
‘God stands in the divine assembly and judges among the gods.’”

Jesus replied, “Well said, Mary.”

## What it means

This chapter is both a celebration and a warning. Jesus praises Andrew and Mary for recognizing how Sophia’s cry echoes the Psalms—ancient wisdom repeating itself in new layers. It reminds us that our personal cries from the depths are part of a much larger song sung across time by every soul yearning to return to the Light.

At its heart, this chapter is about the final purification of creation. Jesus speaks of a coming fullness—when every last spark of Light is reclaimed and returned to its source. The “tyrant gods” symbolize false powers within and without: egoic forces, delusions, or systems that refuse to surrender to divine truth. These parts of the self hoard energy meant to flow freely and resist transformation.

The “wise fire” is a symbol of divine discernment and truth. It’s not a fire of vengeance, but one of sacred purification. The perfected ones—those who have passed through their own inner trials—will not be harmed by this fire. Instead, they help channel it to bring all things into wholeness. This reflects the soul’s journey toward integration: even the most stubborn shadows within us must eventually be surrendered to the Light.

Mary’s words show deep spiritual understanding. She sees that judgment is not about punishment, but about realignment. Everything not in harmony with the Light must be refined, and every being—no matter how lost—will be given the chance to return.

## Reflection

* What are the “tyrant gods” within your own life—beliefs, habits, or fears—that resist surrender to the Light?
* How do you experience the “wise fire” of purification? Is it painful, healing, or both?
* Can you trust that even your deepest flaws contain Light that longs to be redeemed?
