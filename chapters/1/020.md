## Chapter 20 — The Limits of Dark Power

Mary asked Jesus:
“My Lord, there are people who know the secret rituals—the dark mysteries taught long ago by rebellious angels. They use these powers to block what is good and righteous. Now that you’ve changed the heavens and taken away the strength of these rulers, will their dark arts still work?”

Jesus replied:
“They won’t work the way they used to. I’ve taken away a third of their power so they can no longer carry out evil in the same way. But those who know the mysteries of a higher realm—the thirteenth aeon—can still draw power from there. If they use those mysteries, they’ll succeed in what they do, because I wasn’t allowed to weaken that realm. The First Mystery has commanded that its power remain untouched.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals something sacred and sobering: God, in divine mercy, has weakened the influence of corrupted powers in the world—but not removed them entirely. The heavens have been altered. A third of the dark power is gone, and evil is less able to act as freely as it once did. This is a sign of hope.

But even in this divine rearrangement, free will remains. There is still access to great spiritual power. Those who know how to reach the heights—who’ve touched the sacred mysteries—can still use that power however they choose. It is not forced into goodness. It waits for the intention of the heart.

The thirteenth aeon symbolizes the most hidden, holy sanctuary of divine wisdom. It is the dwelling of purity, the place where God's light is concentrated. From there, even great strength can be borrowed—but this strength does not judge. It flows according to the heart that reaches for it.

So Jesus is teaching that the battle is not just in heaven—it’s in the soul. Power alone is not the test. The question is: *what will you do with the light you receive?* Will you use it to heal, to love, to bless? Or will you twist it into something that serves only yourself?

### Reflection

* Have I ever misused the gifts God has given me—even in small ways?
* When I seek power, influence, or insight, is it to serve others or to serve my own fear and control?
* Can I trust that God, in love, is limiting the reach of darkness even when it still seems strong?
* Am I willing to let the light pass through me purely, without needing it to prove anything?
