## Chapter 38 — Martha's Humble Interpretation of Sophia's Third Repentance

After Jesus finished explaining the third repentance of Pistis Sophia to his disciples, he said:

“If any of you feels moved by the Spirit, step forward and share your understanding of what Sophia’s repentance means.”

Before he had even finished speaking, Martha came forward. She fell at Jesus’ feet, kissed them, and began to weep deeply. With humility and grief in her voice, she cried out:

“My Lord, please have mercy on me. Show me compassion, and let me speak the interpretation of Sophia’s repentance.”

Jesus reached out his hand to her and said:

“Blessed is the one who humbles themselves, for they will receive mercy. Martha, you are blessed. Go ahead—speak your understanding of Sophia’s prayer.”

**Martha’s Interpretation of Sophia’s Third Repentance**

Martha said:

“My Lord Jesus, the words of Sophia’s third repentance were foretold by your light-power through the prophet David, in what we now call Psalm 69:

1. O Lord God, hear my cry for help.

2. Let those who seek to destroy me be shamed and confused.

3. Let those who mock me with laughter be disgraced.

4. But let all who seek you rejoice and celebrate because of you. Let those who love your saving power always say: ‘May God be exalted!’

5. As for me, I am suffering and poor. Lord, help me. You are my helper and protector—don’t delay!”

And Martha concluded:
“This is the meaning of the third repentance that Pistis Sophia offered—praising the Light from her place of struggle.”

### What it means

This chapter highlights humility as the key to spiritual insight. Martha, not often centered in the Gospels, takes a brave and tender step forward. Weeping and vulnerable, she embodies the spirit of Sophia’s repentance. Jesus not only welcomes her, he blesses her humility.

Her interpretation of Sophia’s words connects them to Psalm 69—a prayer from deep distress. It is a cry for help, but also a declaration of trust in the saving power of the Divine. It acknowledges the pain of being mocked or hunted by others, yet holds space for joy among those who still seek the Light.

Martha’s presence reminds us that wisdom and understanding aren’t limited to the loudest or most authoritative voices. Sometimes, the most powerful insights come from those who kneel first.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt, like Martha, the need to approach the Divine in grief or humility?
* What role does vulnerability play in your own understanding of spiritual truth?
* In a world that often mocks those who seek light and truth, how do you hold on to joy and hope?
