## Chapter 43 — Mary Explains the Three Witnesses and Philip Speaks

When Jesus said this, he added, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

Mary stepped forward, stood beside Philip, and said to Jesus: “My Lord, the light inside me is ready to hear, and I have understood your words. Now listen as I explain openly, you who said, ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.’

About what you said to Philip: ‘It is you, Thomas, and Matthew— the three witnesses chosen by the First Mystery to write all the teachings of the kingdom of Light and to bear witness.’

Hear then the solution of this word: Your power once prophesied through Moses, ‘By two or three witnesses every matter is confirmed.’ These three witnesses are Philip, Thomas, and Matthew.”

Jesus said, “Well said, Mary, this is the true meaning. Now Philip, come forward and explain the meaning of Pistis Sophia’s fifth repentance.
After that, sit down and continue writing all the teachings until your portion is completed. Then, when you are ready, speak again what your spirit understands. But now, explain the fifth repentance.”

Philip answered Jesus, “My Lord, listen as I explain her repentance. Your power has already prophesied about it through David in the Psalm 87:

1. Lord, God of my salvation,
by day and by night I cry to you.

2. Let my tears come before you; incline your ear to my prayer, O Lord.

3. For my soul is full of trouble, and my life draws near to the underworld.

4. I am counted among those who have fallen, without help, cast down like the dead who lie forgotten.

5. You have placed me in the darkness of death, under a shadow of despair.

6. Your anger weighs upon me,
and all your threats terrify me. (Selah)

7. I am abandoned by friends,
and have become a disgrace to them.

8. My eyes grow dim with sorrow; I cry to you all day
and reach out my hands to you.

9. Will you not perform your wonders for the dead? Will the healers not rise and praise you?

10. Will they not proclaim your name even in the tombs,
and your justice in forgotten places?

11. But I cry to you, Lord,
and my prayer will reach you early.

12. Do not turn away from me,
for I am miserable and sorrowful from my youth.

13. Though I once was proud,
I humbled myself and rose.

14. Your wrath has come upon me, and your terrors confuse me.

15. They surround me like water, and grip me all day.

16. You have kept my companions far from me, and my friends from my suffering.’

This is the meaning of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia, spoken when she was oppressed in the chaos.”

### What it means

This chapter highlights the power of witnesses in confirming spiritual truth—truth is not just one voice but the harmony of several. Mary’s reminder about the “two or three witnesses” points to the importance of community and validation in our spiritual journey.

Philip’s interpretation through Psalm 87 captures the soul’s struggle: feeling overwhelmed, abandoned, and weighed down by darkness, yet still turning toward the Divine with hope and persistence. This reflects our inner experiences when lost or in pain but still seeking light.

This encourages us to acknowledge our darkest emotions without shame and to reach out for help and support. Spiritually, it reminds us that our cries and prayers are heard, even when the way is unclear, and that humility and perseverance lead to renewal.
