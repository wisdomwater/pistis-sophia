## Chapter 62 — Grace and Truth in the Earth and the Heavens

Another Mary (likely Mary of Bethany or another devoted disciple) stepped forward and said:
“My Lord, please be patient with me and do not be angry. From the moment your mother spoke, I felt stirred by the spirit to offer my own understanding of these words.”

Jesus replied, “I invite you—share your interpretation.”

So she said:
“‘Grace and truth met together’—‘Grace’ is the divine spirit that came upon you when you were baptized by John. This spirit, full of compassion for humanity, came down from above and united with the power of Sabaōth the Good that was already within you. That power has made known the truth from the heavenly realms.

When it says, ‘Righteousness and peace kissed each other,’ ‘Righteousness’ is the spirit of the Light that came down upon you, bringing the heavenly mysteries to offer to humanity. ‘Peace’ is the power of Sabaōth the Good within you, who has baptized and forgiven the people, making them reconciled with the sons of the Light.

As your power prophesied through David, ‘Truth sprouted forth out of the earth’—this is the power of Sabaōth the Good that came forth from your mother Mary, the earthly one. ‘Righteousness looked down from heaven’ is the divine spirit from the heights that delivered the mysteries to people so they could become righteous and inherit the Light-Kingdom.”

When Jesus heard this, he said:
“Well said, Mary, you who will inherit the Light.”

Then Mary, his mother, once again came forward, fell at his feet, kissed them, and said:
“My Lord, my son, my Savior—please don’t be angry with me, but let me also share one more understanding of this scripture.

‘Grace and truth met together’—this happened when I, Mary, met Elizabeth, the mother of John. ‘Grace’ is the power of Sabaōth that came forth from me—that is, you, my son. You had compassion on all humanity. ‘Truth’ is the power in Elizabeth—that is, John the Baptizer—who came ahead of you to proclaim the path of Truth.

So again, ‘Grace and truth met together’ refers to you and John meeting on the day you were baptized. And you two are also the ‘Righteousness and peace’ who embraced each other.
‘Truth sprouted forth from the earth’ and ‘Righteousness looked down from heaven’—this speaks of the time you came to me in the form of the angel Gabriel. You looked down from heaven and spoke with me. Then, through your word, you came into being within me. That is the truth—the divine power of Sabaōth the Good in your earthly body—that sprang up from the earth.”

When Jesus heard this, he said:
“Well said, beautifully expressed. This truly is the full meaning of the prophecy my light-power spoke long ago through the prophet David.”

### What it means

This chapter brings us into a rich tapestry of interpretations—three women offer three mystical understandings of the same scripture:

*"Grace and truth met together; righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprang up from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven."*

Each woman sees the sacred pattern of divine and human unity played out in her own experience:

- The second Mary sees it in Jesus’ baptism—the heavenly Spirit joins with the earthly vessel, and the Light’s mysteries begin to be shared with the world.
- Mary the mother sees it in her encounter with Elizabeth—two pregnant women bearing holy children who will change the world. She also sees it in the divine overshadowing at the annunciation, when heaven met earth in her womb.

Jesus affirms all these interpretations, showing that truth is not limited to one event or meaning. Scripture and prophecy are not rigid formulas—they are living patterns of Light. They manifest in many ways, in many people, and always point back to the great mystery: the divine descending into the human, the Spirit entering flesh, the Light becoming visible.

This chapter celebrates the feminine vessels through which this mystery is revealed. Each Mary embodies divine receptivity, insight, and wisdom. Their voices remind us that understanding flows not only from doctrine, but from lived spiritual experience.

### Reflection

* How does the divine pattern of "heaven meeting earth" appear in your own story?
* Can you see grace and truth coming together in your life—in moments of baptism, healing, meeting, or awakening?
* What truths have “sprouted up from the earth” within you? Where do you feel the gaze of righteousness “looking down from heaven”?
