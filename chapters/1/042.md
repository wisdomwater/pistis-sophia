## Chapter 42 — Philip Speaks and Jesus Explains the Role of the Scribes

After Jesus finished speaking, he invited anyone whose spirit was stirred by the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia to come forward and explain its meaning.

Philip, the scribe who records all Jesus’ teachings and actions, stepped forward. He held the book in his hand but hesitated and put it down. Then he said to Jesus, “My Lord, surely it is not only my responsibility to care for the world and write down all the teachings and deeds we share? You have not allowed me to speak the explanation of Pistis Sophia’s repentance, even though my spirit has often been stirred and pushed me to come forward and explain it. But I could not because I am the scribe of all your words.”

Jesus responded kindly to Philip: “Listen, Philip, blessed one. You, Thomas, and Matthew have been appointed by the First Mystery to write down all the teachings I speak, all the things I do, and all that you see. But your task is not yet complete. When it is finished, you may come forward and share whatever you wish. For now, you three must continue to record everything so you can bear witness to the kingdom of heaven.”

### What it means

This chapter highlights the sacred responsibility of recording and witnessing spiritual truths. Philip’s hesitation and inner longing to speak show the tension between the call to observe carefully and the desire to actively interpret and teach.

Spiritually, the scribes symbolize the parts of ourselves that receive divine wisdom and hold the memory of spiritual experience. Their patient role reminds us that spiritual understanding unfolds in stages—sometimes we must listen and record before we are ready to fully explain or teach.

Psychologically, it reflects the discipline needed to honor the process of inner growth: first paying close attention, then integrating what we learn, and only later sharing it with clarity and confidence.

The passage encourages trust in divine timing and the importance of faithfully witnessing our own journey and insights before trying to explain them to others.

### Reflection

* How do you balance the roles of listening, recording, and sharing your own spiritual or inner experiences?
* Are there parts of your inner wisdom that you feel ready to share, and others that still need time to develop?
* What does patience with your own growth and timing look like in your life right now?
