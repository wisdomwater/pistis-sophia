# Chapter 41 — Jesus Praises John and Sophia's Fifth Repentance

After John finished explaining, Jesus praised him, saying, “Well said, John, you who will rule in the kingdom of Light.”

Then Jesus continued teaching his disciples, explaining how Sophia, once again, was oppressed by the forces of Self-will. These forces tried to squeeze out her light and keep her trapped in chaos. Her rescue had not yet been commanded by the highest mysteries, and the call for her salvation had not yet reached Jesus.

In the midst of this suffering, Sophia cried out and spoke her fifth repentance:

1. Light of my salvation, I praise you both in the heights and in the chaos.

2. I sing my hymn of praise that I used when I was in the heights and again in the chaos. Hear my repentance, O Light.

3. My power is filled with darkness, and my light has fallen into chaos.

4. I have become like the rulers of chaos who dwell in darkness below; I have become like a material body with no one above to save it.

5. I have become like things whose power has been taken, cast into chaos and condemned by your decree.

6. Now they have put me in the darkest places—places of death and powerlessness.

7. Your command has come upon me, and all your decrees have been fulfilled.

8. Your spirit has withdrawn from me. Even the emanations of my own realm have abandoned me, hated me, and separated themselves from me. Still, I am not destroyed.

9. My light is fading, but I cry out with all my strength and stretch my hands toward you.

10. O Light, will you not fulfill your command and send your rescuers to rise from the darkness and become your disciples?

11. Will they not reveal the mystery of your name in the chaos?

12. Or will they speak your name in the chaos in a way that you will not purify?

13. I have praised you, O Light, and my repentance reaches to you in the heights.

14. Let your light come upon me.

15. They have taken my light, and I suffer for the Light from the moment I was brought forth. I looked up to the heights and down into the chaos; I rose and fell.

16. Your command and the terrors you decreed have brought me confusion and fear.

17. They have surrounded me like a flood, holding me captive at all times.

18. By your command, you have not allowed my fellow emanations or my counterpart to help or save me from my suffering.

This is the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia, spoken when the material forces of Self-will continued to oppress her in the chaos.

## What it means

This chapter reveals a deeper level of spiritual struggle. Sophia’s light—the divine spark within her—is trapped and weakened by chaotic, self-centered forces (the "emanations of Self-willed"). These forces represent aspects of ego, fear, and confusion that bind us to illusion and suffering.

Sophia’s repentance is a raw, honest cry of pain and abandonment, but also a call for rescue and transformation. She acknowledges feeling isolated, powerless, and rejected—even by parts of herself (her “emanations” and “pair”)—yet she refuses to be destroyed.

Psychologically, this represents those moments when we feel overwhelmed by our inner darkness, when parts of ourselves seem lost or rejected. Spiritually, it is a reminder that these dark times are part of the process of transformation. The call to the Light and the hope for deliverance shows that healing is possible, even when it feels far away.

Sophia’s journey is an invitation to confront the parts of ourselves trapped in chaos and to trust that divine help can come when the time is right. It teaches patience, surrender, and faith amid inner turmoil.

## Reflection

* What parts of yourself feel trapped or abandoned right now? How can you acknowledge their pain without judgment?
* How do you respond to feelings of inner darkness or confusion? Can you find a way to stretch your “hands toward the Light”?
* In what ways might you be resisting help or healing, even when it is available? How can you open to receiving support from within or beyond yourself?
