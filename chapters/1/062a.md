## Note of a Scribe — The Mystery of the Names

This passage appears to be a later addition—a note copied by a scribe from another sacred text. It reads more like a mystical formula than a narrative. Here’s how it unfolds:

“Now these are the names which I will give from the Boundless onward. Write them with a sign, so the Sons of God may be revealed from here on.”

This suggests a transmission of divine names or sounds—mystical syllables that carry spiritual power. The intention is to mark out or reveal those aligned with divine origin (“the Sons of God”).

Then it lists a sequence of syllables and their interpretations:

- The name of the Immortal:  
  `aaa, ōōō`

- The name of the Voice, for whose sake the Perfect Man (likely referring to the spiritual Christ) has moved:  
  `iii`

**Interpretations of the Names**

1. `aaa` → interpreted as `fff`
2. `mmm` or `ōōō` → interpreted as `aaa`
3. `ps ps ps` → interpreted as `ooo`
4. `fff` → interpreted as `nnn`
5. `ddd` → interpreted as `aaa`
6. “He on the throne” is called `aaa`
7. The second interpretation: `aaaa, aaaa, aaaa`
8. “This is the interpretation of the whole name.”

### What it means

This cryptic note reflects a strand of early mystical tradition where sound, vibration, and symbolic letters were believed to carry divine resonance.

The names (`aaa`, `ōōō`, `iii`, etc.) are likely vocalizations used in meditation or ritual, akin to mantras. They were not meant to be understood in a rational, linguistic sense, but rather *experienced* as sacred vibrations that connect the soul with divine realities.

In Gnostic cosmology, such names were often used to invoke or identify specific spiritual beings or states of consciousness. The idea that “the Sons of God may be revealed” suggests that these names help awaken or identify those with a divine spark within them—those who recognize the inner calling of the Light.

The strange syllables and their “interpretations” also reflect a *hidden language*—a mystical code pointing beyond words to pure spiritual truths. This kind of expression is common in apocalyptic and esoteric texts, where meaning is not delivered linearly but symbolically and experientially.

Sometimes, the most sacred things are not said—they are sung, whispered, or felt in silence.

### Reflection

* What role does sound or silence play in your spiritual experience?
* Are there “sacred words” or moments where the language of your soul felt deeper than explanation?
* How might divine truth be communicated not through logic, but through vibration, intuition, or inner resonance?
