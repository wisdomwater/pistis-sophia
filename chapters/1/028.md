# Chapter 28 — The Light Revealed and the Tyrants Overthrown

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples:

“Listen now about what happened when I came among the rulers of the twelve aeons, along with all their lords, authorities, angels, and archangels.

When they saw the radiant robe of light wrapped around me, they—and even their ‘unpaired’ aspects—each recognized the secret of their own name written on my robe. In awe and reverence, they all fell down and worshipped the light of the robe, crying out together, ‘How did the Lord of the universe pass among us and we didn’t even know?’

They began singing praises to the innermost realms of Light.

All their triple-powers, ancient ancestors, uncreated ones, self-created ones, created ones, gods, light-sparks, and light-bearers—all of their great beings—realized something devastating: the tyrants of their realm had lost their power. Seeing this, they were overcome with fear and weakness.

They too saw the mystery of their names written on my robe and wanted to come closer to worship. But the overwhelming brilliance of the light kept them at a distance. So instead, they knelt where they stood and praised the robe’s light, all joining in worship of the innermost Light.

As for the tyrants beneath these rulers—when all this happened, they collapsed. Their power drained from them, and they fell to the ground in their realms like dead bodies—soulless and breathless—just like they did before when I first stripped them of power.

After I left those aeons, all the beings within the twelve realms fell into their proper places and roles, now ordered as I had established. They continued their movements: six months facing the left, doing their work with the triangles, squares, and patterns on that side, and six months facing the right, doing likewise. This same pattern now governs those in Fate and in the sphere.”

## What it means

This chapter depicts a massive cosmic shift where the deeper spiritual truth—the divine identity revealed in Christ—is recognized by all levels of creation, even those that once resisted or opposed it.

The “mystery of their name” written on Jesus’ robe means that each being saw their true nature reflected in his Light. This is the moment of profound recognition: the divine essence of all things originates from the One Light, even the rulers who had forgotten their source. But while the more evolved beings could respond with reverence and praise, the tyrants—symbols of hardened ego, control, and ignorance—collapsed like lifeless shells. Their power was rooted in illusion and darkness, and once Light entered, their structure could not hold.

The “robe of light” represents the radiant manifestation of Divine Truth. It is not just Jesus’ power but the divine pattern that underlies all of creation. Even those furthest from the Light recognized it—though some could only worship from afar.

Jesus then resets the cosmic cycles, establishing order with a new rhythm. The aeons, Fate, and the spheres now turn in harmony with the divine will—suggesting that spiritual awakening reorders not just the soul but the entire universe within and without.

## Reflection

* What might it mean that the rulers saw their “names” on the robe of Light? What name or identity would you see reflected in Divine Light?
* Where in your life are you still ruled by inner tyrants—those parts that resist the Light and collapse when love and truth enter?
* What would it mean to worship from afar—are you keeping a safe distance from something your soul truly longs to embrace?
