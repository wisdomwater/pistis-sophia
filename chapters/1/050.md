## Chapter 50 – The Ninth Repentance of Sophia and the Promise of Thrones

After hearing Matthew's inspired interpretation, Jesus said:  
“Well done, Matthew. Now truly, I tell you: When the full number of the perfected ones is complete and the whole universe is lifted up, I will sit in the Treasury of the Light. And you all will sit upon twelve thrones of light, ruling until all the orders of the twelve Saviors are restored to their rightful places in the divine inheritance.”

Then he asked: “Do you understand what I mean?”

Mary stepped forward and answered:  
“Lord, you once told us this as a parable: ‘You have stayed with me in my trials, and I will give you a kingdom, just as my Father gave one to me. You will eat and drink with me at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’”

Jesus replied: “Well said, Mary.”

He then continued, saying:  
“When the emanations of Self-willed once again attacked Pistis Sophia in the chaos, she cried out in the ninth repentance:

**The Ninth Repentance of Pistis Sophia**

1. O Light, strike down those who have stolen my power, and take their power away from them.

2. I am your power and your light—come and rescue me.

3. Let thick darkness fall upon those who oppress me. Speak to my power: ‘I am the one who will save you.’

4. May those who try to strip me of my light become powerless and fall back into chaos.

5. Let their strength turn to dust. Let Yew, your angel, strike them down.

6. If they try to ascend, let darkness seize them and drag them down again. Let Yew chase them and cast them into the lower darkness.

7. They set a lion-faced power as a trap for me—though I did nothing to harm them. But they cannot steal the divine spark within me.

8. O Light, secretly remove the energy from that lion-faced power—the one Self-willed created to capture my light. Take away its power without it realizing.

9. But my power will rejoice in the Light, celebrating my salvation.

10. Every part of me will declare: You alone are Savior! You save me from the lion-faced power and from all who have tried to steal my light.

11. They falsely accused me, saying I knew the mystery of the higher Light—which I did not. They pressured me to reveal it.

12. They did all this to punish me for believing in the Light of the heights. They drained me of my energy and left me dim.

13. When they demanded answers, I sat in darkness, my soul grieving.

14. Yet I still sing to you, O Light. Save me! I know you will, because I’ve always followed your will—from the beginning of my existence, like those in my realm and my spiritual counterpart. I mourned and searched endlessly for you.

15. Now all the forces of Self-willed surround me and rejoice in my suffering. They attacked without mercy.

16. They returned again, testing me harshly, grinding their teeth in hatred, determined to consume all my light.

17. How long, O Light, will you allow them to harm me? Save me from their evil plans, from the lion-faced one. I am alone in this realm among the invisibles.

18. I will still praise you, O Light, in the middle of those who gather against me. I will cry out to you among those who oppress me.

19. Don’t let those who hate me steal my light and celebrate my fall—though I did nothing to deserve their hatred.

20. They flattered me with sweet words, asking about mysteries I do not know. Then they turned and slandered me, raging against my faith in the higher Light.

21. They opened their mouths and said: “Good—let’s take her light from her.”

22. But you, O Light, know their schemes. Don’t let them succeed. Stay close to me.

23. Hurry, O Light, stand up for me and avenge me.

24. Judge me fairly according to your goodness. Let them not take away my light.

25. Don’t let them boast: “We’ve devoured her light. Our power is full.”

26. Instead, cover them in darkness. May those who try to steal my light become powerless, wrapped in chaos.

27. Rescue me, so I may rejoice! I long for the thirteenth aeon, the realm of Righteousness. Let your angel Yew’s light shine ever brighter.

28. And I will sing to you always in that sacred realm, your gnosis on my tongue forever.”

### What it means

This chapter opens with Jesus affirming the destiny of his disciples: they will sit with him in the Light’s kingdom, each on a throne of radiant power. This isn’t just a promise of reward—it is a promise of *restoration*. The divine order, broken by chaos and Self-willed forces, will be made whole again through divine justice and the faithful.

Then, the focus returns to Pistis Sophia, trapped and attacked again in the chaos. Her ninth repentance is raw, intense, and unwavering. She calls not only for rescue but for justice—crying out against the lion-faced powers, those dark forces of pride and deception that stole her light and accused her of knowledge she did not have.

Yet even in deep suffering, Sophia does not renounce the Light. She praises, she cries out, and she remains faithful. This is crucial: *faith doesn’t mean never falling into darkness—it means continuing to long for the Light, even when abandoned and broken*.

The “lion-faced power” represents that which appears strong but is spiritually corrupt—hungry for domination. Sophia’s light, her divine essence, can be attacked, but it cannot be taken completely. She remembers who she is. She longs not just for escape but for *transcendence*—to return to the thirteenth aeon, the realm of Righteousness.

### Reflection

* In what ways have you felt unjustly accused, or pressured to be something you are not? How did you respond?
* Sophia calls out for divine judgment and justice. What does justice look like in your own spiritual journey?
* Can you feel your own “longing for the thirteenth aeon”—your soul’s hunger for true peace, alignment, and Light? How does that longing guide you?
