## Chapter 47 — Led, But Not Yet Delivered

After Sophia offered her seventh repentance from within the chaos, Jesus told his disciples that the First Mystery hadn’t yet given him the command to rescue her. But out of deep compassion, he chose to help her anyway. Without waiting for permission, he led her to a part of the chaos that was more spacious and less confining.

When the dark powers of Self-Will noticed she had been moved, they momentarily stopped attacking her. They assumed she was about to be taken out of chaos completely. Sophia, however, still didn’t realize that Jesus was her helper. She didn't recognize him at all. Instead, she kept praising the Light she had once seen—the Light of the Treasury—and believed that was what was helping her now. Even though she was mistaken about the exact source, her faith was real. And because she trusted in the true Light, her prayers would eventually be accepted, and she would be lifted out of chaos.

Still, the time had not yet come for the First Mystery to command her full deliverance.

Jesus continued explaining: When Sophia was moved to that more open space in the chaos, the powers of Self-Will left her alone completely. They thought she was finally being freed. But when they realized she wasn’t leaving chaos after all, they turned back on her—harder than ever before.

Because of this renewed oppression, Sophia cried out again. This was her eighth repentance:

**The Eighth Repentance of Sophia**

1. I've placed my hope in you, O Light. Don’t abandon me in the chaos. Rescue me and save me through your wisdom.

2. Hear me and save me. Be my Savior, O Light. Lead me to your radiance.

3. You are my Redeemer. You will bring me back to you. For the sake of your sacred name, guide me and share your mystery with me.

4. Rescue me from the lion-faced power—this trap set for me—because you are my Savior.

5. I place the cleansing of my light in your hands. You’ve already saved me through your wisdom.

6. You are angry with those who trap me. They will not succeed in overpowering me. I continue to trust in your Light.

7. I will rejoice and sing because you have shown me mercy. You saw my suffering and rescued me. You will free my power from this chaos.

8. You have not left me in the grip of the lion-faced power. You have brought me into a region that is no longer crushed by oppression.

### What it means

This chapter is a sacred turning point. Sophia, still deep in her journey through chaos, is met not with full deliverance, but with partial relief. Moved to a "spacious region," her suffering lessens—but her full freedom hasn’t come. This mirrors those moments in our own healing journey when things get a little better, but not fully resolved.

Jesus acts out of compassion, not obligation. The First Mystery hasn't yet ordered Sophia’s release, but Divine Love cannot wait. This suggests that mercy and compassion are deeper than any cosmic law — Love always finds a way to help us, even before we recognize it.

Sophia doesn’t know that Jesus is helping her. She praises the Light, unaware of its true form. Yet her faith is enough. This is a profound teaching: even imperfect or incomplete faith still counts when it comes from the heart. It’s not about getting everything right; it’s about trusting in the goodness and wisdom of the Divine.

The lion-faced power is a symbol of aggressive egoic forces — those inner patterns of fear, control, and self-destruction that snare us when we try to grow. The "powers of Self-Will" represent the psychological forces that keep us trapped in suffering: addiction, pride, shame, self-condemnation. When these forces see us getting free, they often come back harder. That’s not failure—it’s a sign of transformation.

Sophia’s eighth prayer is one of fierce trust. She hands over her purification process. She names her faith. She rejoices even in the middle of the battle.

This chapter invites us to keep going, even when liberation feels just out of reach. The Light is working behind the scenes. Compassion is always present—even when we don’t yet see the full picture.

### Reflection

* Have there been moments in your life where you were being helped but didn’t realize it until much later?
* What “lion-faced” patterns in your mind or behavior try to pull you back when you start to grow?
* How can you deepen your trust in the Light even when you're still in the middle of chaos?
