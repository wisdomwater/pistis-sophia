## Chapter 24 — The Longing of the Soul for Understanding

After Jesus had finished speaking, Mary—the one whose words are full of grace and whose heart is deeply blessed—came forward again. She bowed at Jesus’ feet and said:

“My Lord, please allow me to speak once more. Do not be angry with me if I ask many questions, even if I trouble you again.”

Jesus, ever compassionate and gentle, replied:

“Speak freely, Mary. I will reveal everything to you with full openness.”

Then Mary asked:
“My Lord, how exactly do souls become delayed here in the outer world? And in what way are they purified more quickly?”

### What it means

This chapter is brief, but beautiful. It reveals the tender relationship between Mary and Jesus—a soul deeply yearning to understand the workings of salvation, and a Master who welcomes every question with patience and love.

Mary, called “fair in her discourse,” symbolizes the soul awakened to divine longing. She keeps returning—not out of doubt, but out of desire to draw closer, to understand more fully. Her repeated questioning is not burdensome to Jesus; rather, He honors it. Divine Wisdom never tires of our seeking.

Her question, though simple, touches something profound: *Why do some souls remain stuck in this outer world, while others rise more quickly into light?* This is the heart-cry of one who loves others, who feels the ache of delay, and who hopes for the swifter healing of all.

Symbolically, this is a dialogue between the soul and the Divine Light. The soul asks: *Why am I still here? Why do I wander? What must I do to be purified?* And Jesus responds, not with rebuke, but with an invitation to go deeper into mystery.

### Reflection

* Do I trust that my honest questions are welcomed by the Divine?
* In what ways might my soul be “delayed” in the outer world—caught in illusion, distraction, or fear?
* Am I seeking a quicker path to purification—not out of impatience, but out of love for the Light?
* What does it mean to me to sit at the feet of the Teacher and be called “blessed”?
