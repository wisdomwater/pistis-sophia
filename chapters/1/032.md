## Chapter 32 — Sophia's First Repentance

And Sophia cried out with great anguish. She called out to the Light of Lights—the divine radiance she had trusted from the beginning—and offered this prayer of repentance:

1. O Light of Lights, whom I trusted from the start, please hear me now. Receive my repentance and save me, for confusion and dark thoughts have entered me.

2. I looked downward and saw a light and thought it was yours. I descended to take it, but instead found myself trapped in the chaos. The lion-faced being stole my light, and I can’t return to my home above.

3. I cried out for help, but my voice couldn’t escape the darkness. I looked back to the height, hoping the Light would save me.

4. But instead, I saw the rulers of the aeons rejoicing in my downfall. I had harmed no one, yet they hated me. Seeing their scorn, the forces of Self-Willed grew bold and stole the light I still carried.

5. O Light of Truth, you know I did this out of innocence. I thought the lion-faced light was yours. My error is before you.

6. Don’t let me go without light any longer. I’ve trusted in your radiance from the beginning.

7. Because I longed for your Light, I’ve fallen into this terrible suffering, and shame has surrounded me.

8. The illusion of your Light has made me a stranger to my divine siblings and to the emanations of Barbēlō.

9. I loved your dwelling place too much, and the wrath of Self-Willed came upon me—he who disobeyed you and refused to emanate his power according to your will.

10. The rulers of the aeons mocked me.

11. I remained in that place, mourning and searching for the Light I once saw in the height.

12. The gatekeepers of the aeons searched for me, and others mocked me because I had fallen.

13. Yet I kept looking upward and held faith in you. Now I am deeply pressed in the darkness of chaos. If you will come save me, great is your mercy—please hear and rescue me.

14. Pull me out of this dark matter, so I don’t drown in it. Rescue me from the forces of Self-Willed and their cruelty.

15. Let not this darkness engulf me fully, nor the lion-faced one consume all my light.

16. Hear me, O Light, for your grace is precious. Look upon me with your great mercy.

17. Don’t turn away from me—I am overwhelmed with suffering.

18. Come quickly and save what power I have left.

19. Deliver me from the rulers who hate me. You know my pain and how they’ve tormented me. Those who put me in this evil are known to you—respond to them as you see fit.

20. My soul cried out from chaos, hoping my partner would come help me, but he didn’t. I looked for strength, but none came.

21. I asked for light, but they gave me darkness. I sought power, but they gave me heavy matter.

22. May the darkness and matter they gave me become a trap for them. May they stumble and fail in their ambition.

23. Let them remain in darkness, never seeing the Light or ascending to the heights.

24. Let your judgment reach them, and may they receive justice.

25. Don’t let them return to their region or to their god, Self-Willed. Let his emanations remain locked out. He thought his actions were his own, but had I not been brought low by your command, he would have had no power over me.

26. Because you allowed me to fall, they attacked me more harshly and added to my pain.

27. They have taken more of my light and continue to press me. Don’t let them reach the thirteenth aeon, the realm of Righteousness.

28. Don’t count them among those who purify themselves and receive mysteries through repentance.

29. They’ve stripped me of my light. I am empty and weak.

30. But you, O Light, still dwell in me. I sing praises to your name in hope.

31. May my song be accepted by you as a sacred offering, like a hidden mystery that leads others to your gates. Let those who repent sing it and be cleansed.

32. Let all creation rejoice and seek the Light, that the star-power in each of us may come alive.

33. The Light hears all who dwell in matter—it will not leave anyone behind.

34. Let souls and matter praise the Lord of all aeons.

35. For God will rescue their souls from the heaviness of matter. A holy city awaits them in the Light, and all who are saved will live there.

36. The souls who receive the mysteries will dwell in that place, abiding forever in its name.

### What it means

This chapter is Sophia’s first major prayer of repentance—a raw, emotional outpouring from the depths of suffering. She recognizes her mistake, admits her confusion, and pleads for the true Light to rescue her. It's a sacred moment of turning back—a spiritual cry from exile.

Sophia's descent mirrors our own when we make choices based on illusion, even with good intentions. She wasn’t driven by malice but by a deep longing for union with the Light. Still, her lack of discernment led to her entrapment.

This repentance is full of wisdom: she acknowledges the harm, expresses faith, seeks justice, and desires purification. Importantly, she doesn’t just want to be saved—she also wants the false powers that deceived her to be corrected and prevented from harming others.

The ending shifts from lament to hope. She praises the Light even in her suffering and affirms that all creation—even what is trapped in matter—can be redeemed. The “city in the Light” symbolizes a future realm of peace, belonging, and spiritual restoration.

### Reflection

* When have you realized you were following an illusion rather than true inner guidance?
* How do you express your own repentance—not in shame, but in trust that the Light hears you?
* What “city in the Light” do you hope to inherit? What does restoration look like for your soul?
