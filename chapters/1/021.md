# Chapter 21 — The Disruption of False Prophets

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary continued with another question:
“My Lord, now that you’ve changed the heavens, will those who read the stars—those who cast horoscopes and seek omens—still be able to tell people what the future holds?”

Jesus answered:
“If they happen to observe the stars when the heavens are turned to the left, as they once were, then yes, what they say might still come true. But if they try when the heavens are turned to the right, their predictions will be false. I have changed their patterns—their alignments, the paths they relied on.
Before, everything moved only to the left. Their signs and shapes—the squares, triangles, and other symbols—were consistent. But now, I have divided time: six months they move left, six months they move right. Only someone who understands this new rhythm will be able to interpret it rightly.

As for those who call upon spirits or rulers for knowledge—if they call them while they face left, they might still receive answers. But if they call while the rulers are turned right, they will receive nothing truthful. The names, the forms, the responses—they’re all different now. These spirits will not listen the same way; instead, they will confuse and disturb those who ask, even threaten them.

So those who don’t understand this change, who try to interpret the signs by the old ways, will be lost in confusion. Their readings will be unreliable. I’ve done this deliberately, so the rulers and powers in the heavens—those who dwell in these high places—will be thrown into disorder. Their former clarity is gone. Now they will be lost even in their own paths.”

## What it means

This chapter reveals the mercy of God in disrupting the old powers that once claimed authority over fate. Jesus has broken the rigid predictability of the stars and the influence of spirits who once whispered secrets to those who sought them. He has bent the heavens—not to make life more difficult, but to free the soul from false certainty.

Those who tried to control life through divination and secret knowledge now find themselves confused. The patterns no longer work the way they used to. This is grace: when God interrupts what once enslaved us.

The turning to the left represents the old patterns—predictable, habitual, the way things have always been. The right points to transformation, to the Divine will working in new and unexpected ways. Only the humble heart, surrendered and watchful, will be able to move with these new rhythms. All others—those who try to manipulate, dominate, or predict—will be confounded.

This is not punishment. It is protection. It is the Father’s way of leading us out of slavery to the stars, into the living breath of the Spirit.

## Reflection

* Do you still look to external signs—stars, systems, or people—to give you a sense of control over life?
* Are you willing to live in uncertainty, trusting that God is the one guiding all things?
* Have you been clinging to outdated ways of thinking, old patterns that once “worked,” but no longer bring truth or peace?
