## Chapter 53 — The Soul Among Strangers

After telling his disciples about Sophia’s tenth repentance, Jesus said, “Now, if anyone feels moved by the Spirit, let them step forward and share the meaning of what she has just said.”

Peter responded, “Lord, your light-power once spoke through David in Psalm 119 about this very moment. It says:

1. I cried to you, O Lord, in my suffering—and you listened.

2. Lord, save my soul from lies and deceptive words.

3. What reward can come from a deceitful tongue?

4. Sharp arrows from the mighty one are kindled with desert fire.

5. Woe is me! I live far from home, among the tents of Kedar.

6. My soul has wandered through foreign lands.

7. I was a lover of peace, but those around me hated it. When I spoke, they attacked me without reason.

“This, O Lord, is the meaning of Sophia’s tenth repentance. She spoke these words when she was being harshly oppressed by the material forces of the Self-willed being and his lion-faced power.”

Jesus replied, “Well said, Peter. That is indeed the true interpretation of Sophia’s repentance.”

### What it means

This chapter continues the rhythm of affirmation and reflection that threads through *Pistis Sophia*. After Sophia pours out her sorrow and hope in the tenth repentance, Jesus invites the disciples to engage—not to simply listen, but to respond from within. Peter does so by connecting Sophia’s words to a Psalm of David, showing how the human experience of exile, deception, and longing for peace spans time, soul, and scripture.

The tents of Kedar—symbolic of wandering and spiritual estrangement—evoke the soul’s feeling of being far from home, dwelling in a place that does not understand it. Sophia, like many of us, is portrayed as one who loves peace but is surrounded by hostility. Her cry is the cry of the awakened soul in a world that does not yet recognize the Light.

Peter’s interpretation is not just a scholarly exercise—it’s an act of solidarity. He is saying: Sophia’s words are *our* words too. Her journey mirrors the inner life of anyone who seeks the Light in a world that seems to reject it.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt like a stranger in the world, longing for a spiritual home?
* How do you respond when your desire for peace is met with hostility or misunderstanding?
* What words or images from ancient texts—like the Psalms—still feel alive and relevant to your own inner journey?
