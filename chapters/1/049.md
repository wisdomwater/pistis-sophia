## Chapter 49 — Matthew Interprets Sophia's Eighth Repentance

After Jesus had finished speaking, Matthew stepped forward and said, “My Lord, your Spirit has stirred my heart, and your Light has brought me clarity, so that I may speak the eighth repentance of Pistis Sophia. For your power once spoke through David about this moment in the thirtieth Psalm, saying:

1. I have put my hope in you, O Lord. Don’t let me be put to shame. Save me because you are just and good.  

2. Turn your ear to me—rescue me quickly. Be my shelter, my safe house, and protect me.  

3. You are my strength and refuge. For the sake of your name, guide me and nourish me.  

4. Pull me out of the trap they secretly laid for me, because you are my protector.  

5. Into your hands I entrust my spirit. You have redeemed me, O Lord, God of Truth.  

6. You reject those who follow hollow illusions, but I have placed my trust in you.  

7. I will rejoice in you, Lord, and celebrate your grace. You saw my lowliness and saved me from desperate need.  

8. You didn’t hand me over to my enemies. You gave me space to stand tall and free.  

9. Be kind to me, Lord—I am suffering. My eyes are clouded with grief, and my soul and body are worn out.  

10. My years have melted away in sorrow. My life is spent sighing. My strength is drained by anguish, and my bones are crumbling.  

11. I’ve become a joke to all my enemies and even to my neighbors. A terror to those who know me. When people see me, they run the other way.  

12. I’m forgotten like the dead—like a broken piece of pottery, discarded and useless.  

13. I’ve heard the whispers of many around me. They surround me with scorn. They plot together to take my soul.  

14. But I trust in you, Lord. I say: “You are my God.”  

15. My fate is in your hands. Save me from my enemies and from those who hunt me.  

16. Let your face shine upon your servant. Save me through your mercy, Lord.  

17. Don’t let me be put to shame, for I have called out to you. Let the arrogant be shamed instead, and brought down into the depths.  

18. Silence the deceitful lips—those who speak evil against the innocent with pride and contempt.

### What it means

This chapter reflects a soul in deep anguish yet still choosing to turn toward the Light. Matthew, interpreting the eighth repentance of Sophia, draws from Psalm 31—a lament of one who is surrounded by sorrow, misunderstood, even hunted, and yet who does not abandon trust in God.

Pistis Sophia here represents the part of us that, despite collapse, continues to hope. Her journey echoes the inner terrain of anyone who has suffered rejection, despair, or the slow erosion of self-worth. In her cry, we hear the voice of the brokenhearted who still dares to say, *"You are my God."*

The repeated image of being forgotten, discarded, and mocked reflects a universal fear: that our suffering will make us unlovable or unseen. Yet even in the shadow of shame, Sophia places her spirit in the hands of the Divine. This is not passive surrender—it’s an act of fierce inner faith.

God's justice here is not punitive, but rescuing. The Divine is a shelter, a protector, a redeemer. And the soul, even after years of weariness, is never beyond mercy. In this, we are reminded: no matter how deep our grief, we are never alone. The Light sees. The Light redeems.

### Reflection

* When have I felt forgotten or discarded like “a broken piece of pottery”? What helped me trust again?
* In what ways do I still try to control my fate rather than entrusting it to Divine care?
* How can I hold both my pain and my hope in the same breath, like Sophia does in this prayer?
