# Chapter 17 — Summary and Reflection

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them listen carefully.”

Mary Magdalene, upon hearing this, stared intently into the air for about an hour. Then she said, “My Lord, please give me permission to speak openly.”

Jesus, full of compassion, replied, “Mary, you are blessed. I will perfect you in all the mysteries from the highest realms. Speak freely, for your heart is closer to the kingdom of heaven than all your brothers.”
