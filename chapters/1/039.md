## Chapter 39 – Sophia’s Fourth Repentance: A Cry from the Depths of Chaos

After Martha had finished speaking, Jesus said to her:

“Well spoken, Martha—very well done.”

Then he turned again to his disciples and continued teaching them:

“Pistis Sophia offered her fourth repentance before she was attacked again. She cried out in advance, hoping that the lion-faced power and the material beings that Self-willed had sent into the chaos wouldn’t completely drain her of light. She prayed this way:

**The Fourth Repentance of Sophia:**

1. O Light, the One I have trusted—listen to my plea. Let my voice rise to your holy place.

2. Don’t turn your radiant face away from me. Pay attention, especially when I’m attacked, and come quickly when I call out for help.

3. My time has vanished like a breath—I’ve become just matter.

4. They’ve stolen my light. My power is dried up. I’ve forgotten the mystery I once performed with ease.

5. The terrifying voice and force of Self-willed have drained me of strength.

6. I feel like a demon, trapped in matter, cut off from light. I’m like a fake spirit locked in a body with no light-power inside.

7. I’m like a decan—one of the stars—alone in the empty sky.

8. The forces of Self-willed have crushed me, and even my soul-mate (my “pair”) has said:

9. “Instead of light, she’s now filled with chaos.” I’ve wept and labored with no rest, trying to hold onto what little remains so that those who attack me won’t steal the last of it.

10. All of this has happened because of your divine command. It is your will that I am here.

11. Your command sent me down, and I became trapped in the chaos. My power feels frozen inside me.

12. But you, O Lord, are eternal Light. You visit and care for those who are constantly oppressed.

13. So now, O Light, come and find my power and the soul within me. Your plan has played out in my suffering. Now is the time you set to come and rescue me.

14. Your saviors have searched for the power within my soul, because the time is fulfilled, and even my material part can now be saved.

15. When that happens, all the rulers of the material worlds will tremble before your Light. Even the beings from the thirteenth material realm will fear the mystery of your radiance, and others will begin to purify their own light.

16. For the Lord seeks the power within your soul. He has revealed his great mystery,

17. So he may look kindly on the repentance of those stuck in the lower realms—and he has not ignored their cries.

18. This mystery becomes a sign for future generations, and those who come after will sing praises to the heights.

19. For the Light has looked down from its radiant home—it sees all of matter.

20. It hears the cries of those who are chained,

21. And it will free the soul’s power that has been imprisoned—planting its Name and its mystery within the soul and its strength.”

### What it means

Sophia’s fourth repentance is the raw cry of a soul lost in deep spiritual exile. She recognizes how far she has fallen—from a being of Light to one made of matter, drained of power, feeling fake, alien, and alone.

Yet even in the depths of chaos, she remembers that this descent was not random—it was part of a divine command. There’s a strange hope here: if the fall was permitted by the Light, then surely the return is also possible.

Sophia believes the time has come for redemption. Her prayer holds both a lament for what’s been lost and a deep trust that the Light hasn’t forgotten her. She speaks not only for herself but for all those who are “chained” and “oppressed”—souls caught in the illusions and traps of the material world.

The Light sees, hears, and will act. That’s the mystery: the divine doesn’t abandon the fallen but descends to meet them, planting truth in their very being.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt like Sophia—drained, lost, or disconnected from your own inner light?
* What does it mean to you that even suffering might be part of a larger divine plan?
* Where in your life do you need to remember that the Light sees and hears you?
* How might your own story of struggle become a “sign” to future generations?
