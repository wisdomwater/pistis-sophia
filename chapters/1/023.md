## Chapter 23 — The Mercy Hidden in the Disruption

Jesus replied to Philip and to all the disciples, saying:

“I changed the path of the rulers and their domains for the salvation of all souls.

Truly, truly, I tell you: if I had not changed their course, many souls would have been lost. The rulers of the heavenly realms, of Fate, of the spheres, of all the heavens and all the aeons—they would have held on to their power, and souls would have remained trapped for ages.

The number of perfected souls—those destined to inherit the Light—would have been delayed. These are the souls who, through sacred mysteries, are gathered into the Treasury of the Light.

That is why I overturned their path: to unsettle them, to make them yield the power hidden in matter, the very power they used to craft souls. In this way, those destined for salvation could be freed more quickly, cleansed, and lifted upward with all their strength.

And those who are not meant to be saved would fall away quickly.”

### What it means

Jesus speaks with divine urgency and purpose. His actions—cosmic, invisible, mysterious—are rooted in a deep desire to rescue souls. What seems like chaos in the heavens is, in truth, the unfolding of mercy.

The rulers—those spiritual powers once fixed and formidable—had to be undone. They had become gatekeepers, imprisoning the light within matter, slowing the journey of the soul. Jesus unhinged them—not for vengeance, but for liberation.

Every soul matters in this plan. Jesus is saying: *“If I had not intervened, they would be lost. And the full family of light would remain incomplete.”* There is a deep tenderness here—a Shepherd unwilling to let any of his flock remain in bondage.

Symbolically, this is the shattering of inner strongholds—beliefs, systems, false powers—that hold the soul down. When God disrupts, it is always to redeem. The shaking of the heavens reflects the shaking within us when grace breaks in and tears down what binds us.

### Reflection

* Where in my life have I experienced divine disruption that later revealed itself as salvation?
* What “rulers” still hold sway over my soul—false identities, patterns, or fears that keep the light within me captive?
* Am I willing to let Jesus overturn what feels fixed in me for the sake of my freedom?
* Do I believe that His purpose is always to bring me more fully into the Light?
