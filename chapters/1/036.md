## Chapter 36 – Peter's Complaint and the Interpretation of Sophia’s Second Repentance

After Jesus finished speaking, he asked his disciples, “Do you understand the way I’m explaining these things to you?”

Then Peter stepped forward and said to him:

“My Lord, we’re struggling to endure this woman—she always jumps in and doesn’t give the rest of us a chance to speak. She keeps speaking over us.”

Jesus replied to his disciples, “Let anyone whose spirit is stirred with understanding come forward and speak. And now, Peter, I can see that your spirit understands the meaning of Sophia’s second repentance. So come, speak your insight to your fellow disciples.”

Then Peter responded and said:

“My Lord, allow me to share the meaning of her repentance—something your own divine power foretold long ago through the prophet David, in what is now known as Psalm 70:

1. O God, my God, I have trusted you—never let me be put to shame.

2. Save me through your justice; set me free; listen and rescue me.

3. Be my solid refuge and strong protection—for you are my strength and my shelter.

4. Save me, O God, from the hands of sinners, transgressors, and the wicked.

5. You’ve been my strength since I was young—you are my hope.

6. I’ve trusted in you since I was in the womb; you brought me into the world. My heart always remembers you.

7. I’ve seemed like a madwoman to many—but you are my help, my strength, and my deliverer.

8. My mouth overflows with praise for your splendor all day long.

9. Don’t abandon me when I grow old; if my soul weakens, stay close.

10. My enemies whisper against me; those who seek my downfall plot together,

11. Saying, ‘God has left her—let’s chase her down; no one will save her now.’

12. But God, pay attention—help me.

13. May those who slander me be ashamed and destroyed; may those who wish me harm be wrapped in disgrace.”

Jesus concluded: “This is the true interpretation of Sophia’s second repentance.”

### What it means

This chapter brings both tension and insight. Peter expresses frustration with Mary, revealing the discomfort of patriarchal dynamics even among Jesus’ disciples. But Jesus doesn't shame Peter—instead, he refocuses the group on spiritual readiness. He reminds them: whoever truly understands in spirit may speak.

Peter is then invited to interpret Sophia’s second repentance. He links it to Psalm 70, showing how ancient scripture echoes her cry. The Psalm reflects the same themes: trust in God despite shame, persecution, or abandonment. The enemies in the Psalm—those who say “God has left her”—mirror the powers that try to crush Sophia’s light.

This passage reminds us that spiritual authority isn’t about who speaks most, but who speaks with understanding. It also shows how the soul’s lament is timeless—Sophia’s voice is the echo of all souls crying out for help, especially when they feel forsaken.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt dismissed or silenced like Mary, or frustrated like Peter? How do you respond in those moments?
* When do you find yourself crying out like Sophia or the Psalmist, feeling surrounded or shamed?
* What helps you keep faith when it seems like the Light—or God—has gone quiet?
