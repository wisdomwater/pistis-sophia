# Chapter 52 — The Last Shall Be First

After James spoke, Jesus said to him, “Well done, James. You’ve given the true meaning of Sophia’s ninth repentance. Truly, I tell you: you and those who carry out my mysteries will be first in the kingdom of heaven—even before all invisible beings, gods, and rulers in the twelfth and thirteenth aeons.”

Then Jesus asked them, “Do you understand what I mean?”

Mary stepped forward and said, “Yes, Lord. You once told us, ‘The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.’ The ones created before us—the invisible powers, the gods, and the rulers—came into being before humanity. But those who receive the mysteries will be the first to enter the kingdom.”

Jesus answered, “Well said, Mary.”

Then he continued: “After Sophia cried out with her ninth repentance, the lion-faced power came after her again, trying to steal what little power she had left. She cried once more to the Light:

‘O Light, you in whom I’ve always believed, for whose sake I have endured such suffering—help me.’

And at that moment, her repentance was accepted. The First Mystery heard her cry, and I was sent to help her. I came into the chaos and led her upward because she had repented, kept her faith in the Light, and endured immense pain and danger. She was deceived—not by any dark force—but by a light-power that resembled the true Light she loved. That’s why I was sent secretly by the First Mystery, so no power, inward or outward, would know—only the First Mystery.

When I entered the chaos, she saw me. She recognized that I understood her, that I radiated compassion, and that I was not like the self-willed lion-faced power who had stolen her light and tried to strip her completely. She saw that I shone far brighter—ten thousand times more—and she knew I had come from the Highest Light, the very one she had trusted from the beginning. Her heart lifted with courage, and she cried out her tenth repentance:

1. I called to you, O Light of lights, in my suffering—and you heard me.

2. O Light, save me from lies and deception, from all traps set to ensnare me.

3. The light stolen through trickery will not reach you.

4. The nets of Self-willed and the merciless are laid out to trap me.

5. How terrible it is that I lived far from you, deep in the chaos.

6. My power was trapped in a realm that was not mine.

7. I begged the merciless ones for help, but they only attacked me without cause.

## What it means

This chapter marks a turning point in Sophia’s journey—and in the soul’s journey. The Light hears her. Her pain, her endurance, and most importantly, her faith in the midst of delusion move the First Mystery to respond. Jesus, the emissary of the Light, comes not with judgment, but with compassion and radiant clarity.

Sophia mistook a counterfeit light for the true Light—not out of rebellion, but out of love. And even though she was deceived, she never gave up hope. She continued to repent, to cry out, to long for truth. This persistence is what saves her. In the depths of chaos, when all seems lost, the true Light comes—not with thunder, but in secret—because the soul's healing is an intimate, inward event.

The lion-faced power represents the false inner voice that mimics truth but drains us—self-will, pride, or compulsive control. Jesus' radiance surpasses it, not through force, but through presence and understanding. He reflects the Light of the Highest, and Sophia recognizes it. In that recognition, she finds strength to speak once more—not with despair, but with a cry of faith and hope.

This chapter reminds us that when we are furthest from home—spiritually or emotionally—and feel most lost, our cries still matter. They reach the Divine. And help will come, though often in ways quieter and more tender than we expect.

## Reflection

* Have you ever mistaken something false for truth, only to find it left you empty or drained?
* What keeps your faith alive when you feel lost in the chaos of life?
* In what ways might the Divine be showing up for you quietly, even now?
