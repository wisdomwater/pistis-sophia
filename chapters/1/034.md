## Chapter 34 – Mary’s Insight Affirmed

After Mary finished speaking to Jesus in front of the other disciples, she said, “My Lord, this is the hidden meaning behind the repentance of Pistis Sophia.”

When Jesus heard what Mary had said, he responded, “Well done, Mary. You are truly blessed—filled with divine fullness. Generations to come will call you blessed and sing your praises.”

### What it means

This short chapter highlights the importance of spiritual insight and the value of inner listening. Mary doesn’t just repeat the words of Sophia—she understands their deeper meaning. She recognizes the spiritual mystery behind the outer story, and Jesus confirms that her interpretation is correct.

Symbolically, Mary represents the awakened aspect of the soul that not only receives divine truth but also discerns its significance. She embodies the feminine wisdom that listens deeply, sees with clarity, and speaks with trust. In affirming her, Jesus acknowledges the power of receptive, intuitive understanding as a sacred pathway to truth.

This moment is also an invitation to the reader: we are not just meant to observe Sophia’s journey but to understand it inwardly, like Mary. We are called to see our own story in hers, and to recognize how our insights—when rooted in truth and love—can be honored and affirmed by the Divine.

### Reflection

* When have you felt that you truly understood something on a deep, spiritual level—not just intellectually?
* Do you trust your inner knowing, or do you doubt it? What would it take to believe that your insight is valuable?
* What role does “divine feminine” wisdom—listening, intuition, inner seeing—play in your spiritual life?
