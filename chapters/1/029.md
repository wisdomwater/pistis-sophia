## Chapter 29 — Jesus Finds Sophia in Exile

Jesus said:

“After these things, I ascended to the veils guarding the thirteenth aeon. When I reached them, the veils opened on their own and let me pass through. As I entered the thirteenth aeon, I found Pistis Sophia below it—alone, with no one beside her.

She was grieving and mourning, because she had not been allowed to enter the thirteenth aeon, her rightful home. She was also in sorrow because of the suffering inflicted on her by a being named Self-Willed, one of the three great triple-powers. (I’ll explain more about what happened to her when I describe how these powers expanded.)

When Sophia saw me surrounded by brilliant light—light so vast it couldn’t be measured—she was deeply shaken. She fixed her eyes on the light of my robe and saw the mystery of her name written on it, along with the full glory of that mystery.

You see, Sophia had once been in the heights, within the thirteenth aeon. She used to sing praises to the higher Light she had glimpsed shining through the veil of the Treasury of the Light.

Because she kept singing to that higher Light, the rulers who were with the two great triple-powers—and even her own paired being and the other twenty-two invisible emanations—took notice of her. Together, Sophia, her pair, and these twenty-two make up twenty-four emanations that had been brought forth by the great invisible Forefather and the two triple-powers.”

### What it means

This chapter marks the moment Jesus re-encounters Pistis Sophia, the soul who has fallen from the higher realms.

Sophia—whose name means “Wisdom”—has been exiled beneath her true home in the thirteenth aeon. She longs to return but is trapped in sorrow and isolation. Her suffering comes, in part, from Self-Willed, a force that represents pride, ego, or will separated from divine harmony.

When she sees Jesus clothed in Light, she recognizes her true name—her divine identity—shining in Him. This moment of recognition is both overwhelming and hopeful. Though fallen, Sophia is not forgotten. Her essence still exists within the Light; her name is still written there.

Her story is one of devotion and tragedy. She was reaching for the higher Light, drawn by the Divine—but her yearning led to her fall, and the spiritual powers around her took notice. The "twenty-four emanations" she’s part of represent a cosmic order—spiritual expressions born of the original Source. Her fall disrupts that order, and her redemption will help restore it.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt like Sophia—cut off from your true home, yet still reaching for the Light?
* What might “Self-Willed” look like in your own life? In what ways can ego or pride lead us into separation?
* How do you imagine your true name—your divine identity—being written in the Light? What would it mean to recognize it?
