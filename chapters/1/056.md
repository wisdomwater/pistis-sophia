## Chapter 56 — Andrew Interprets Sophia's Twelfth Repentance through Psalm 108

After Jesus finished recounting Sophia’s twelfth repentance, Andrew stepped forward and said:

“My Lord and Savior, the words of Sophia’s repentance were prophesied long ago by your light-power through David, in the 108th Psalm.”

Andrew then quoted from the psalm, showing how each part mirrors Sophia’s plea:

1. O God, do not stay silent when I sing praises to you.
2. The mouths of sinners and deceivers have opened against me; they speak lies behind my back.
3. They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.
4. Instead of love, they offer slander—but I kept praying.
5. They return evil for good and hate for love.
6. Appoint a wicked one over him, and let a slanderer stand at his side.
7. May he be judged guilty, and may even his prayers turn into sin.
8. May his life be cut short, and someone else take his position.
9. May his children be left fatherless and his wife become a widow.
10. May his children be driven out, forced to beg and lose their home.
11. Let creditors seize everything he has, and strangers steal all his work.
12. May no one show him kindness or help his orphans.
13. May his descendants be wiped out, and his name forgotten within a generation.
14. Let the sins of his ancestors never be erased, not even the sin of his mother.
15. Let these sins always be remembered before the Lord, and let his memory disappear from the earth.
16. For he showed no mercy and persecuted the poor, the afflicted, and the broken.
17. He loved to curse others—so let curses cling to him. He refused blessings—so let them stay far away.
18. He wore cursing like a robe; it soaked into him like water, like oil in his bones.
19. May it cling to him like clothing, binding him forever.
20. This is what happens to those who slander and speak against my soul.
21. But you, O Lord God, have mercy on me; save me for your name’s sake.
22. I am poor and in pain; my heart is in turmoil.
23. I feel like a fading shadow, like a grasshopper tossed in the wind.
24. My knees are weak from fasting; my body is worn and dry.
25. I’ve become a joke to them; they laugh and mock me.
26. Help me, Lord God; save me with your grace.
27. Let them see that this deliverance is your doing, O Lord.

Andrew concluded: “This is the true meaning of the twelfth repentance which Pistis Sophia cried out while trapped in the chaos.”

### What it means

This chapter draws a clear connection between Sophia’s cry for justice and Psalm 108 (109 in most modern Bibles). Andrew sees in David’s ancient words a prophetic echo of Sophia’s pain. The psalm becomes a mystical key that helps interpret her suffering—not as meaningless agony, but as a story already woven into divine history.

Andrew’s interpretation legitimizes Sophia’s struggle and situates it within a broader sacred tradition. She is not alone, nor is her cry new. The soul who loves the Light, like the psalmist, will often be surrounded by those who seek to silence or destroy them. Yet their suffering is not in vain.

This chapter also affirms that scripture can be read not only historically, but mystically—revealing truths about the soul’s journey, the betrayal it faces, and the mercy it hopes for.

### Reflection

* Have you ever found comfort in old texts or prayers that seemed to echo your own pain?
* In a world that often mocks vulnerability, what does it mean to let your weakness be seen—and still cry out for grace?
* Are there wounds in you that feel ancient—yet somehow connected to a much larger, cosmic story?
