## Chapter 2 — The Light Beyond Knowing

It happened that the disciples were gathered together on the Mount of Olives, speaking about all they had learned from Jesus. Their hearts were overflowing with joy, and they said to one another:
“Blessed are we above all people on the earth, because the Savior has revealed these sacred truths to us. We have received the Fullness—the total completion.”

As they spoke these words, Jesus sat a short distance away from them.

Then, on the fifteenth day of the lunar month of Tybi, when the moon was full and the sun had just risen, a powerful light—far brighter than anything they had ever seen—appeared behind the sun. There was no limit to its brilliance. It came from the Light of all lights, from the innermost depths of the last and greatest mystery, the twenty-fourth mystery, emerging from the second space of the First Mystery.

This light descended over Jesus and completely surrounded him. He shone with a radiance that had no measure—too powerful for human eyes.

The disciples could no longer see him directly because the light around him was so overwhelming. Their vision was obscured by the brilliance, and they saw only dazzling beams of light streaming in every direction. Each ray was different from the others—some finer, some more intense—but together they formed one vast, awe-inspiring spectrum that stretched from beneath the earth all the way into the heavens.

When the disciples saw this, they were filled with fear and trembling.

### What it means

This sacred moment tells us something deeply important about the spiritual path. The disciples thought they had reached the end of their journey, having received the “Fullness.” But then, something far greater appears—an overwhelming light from beyond even their deepest understanding. The divine presence reveals itself in a form so radiant that they can’t even see Jesus anymore.

This is what often happens to us, too. Just when we feel certain in our beliefs or feel spiritually “complete,” something comes that humbles us—a mystery that cannot be understood, only encountered. The “light too bright to see” reminds us that the Divine is not always found in what is clear and familiar. Sometimes, it comes in the form of wonder, silence, or even disorientation.

The full moon and rising sun suggest a balance of opposites: the reflected light of the moon and the originating fire of the sun. The descent of divine light over Jesus represents divine consciousness breaking into human awareness. But this awareness doesn’t come as a gentle insight—it comes as a brilliance that outshines the known and pulls us into awe.

The disciples' fear reminds us that encountering the true Light can be unsettling. But it also means we are standing at the threshold of transformation.

### Reflection

* Have you ever experienced a moment when something you thought you fully understood was suddenly revealed to be much deeper and more mysterious?
* What does it feel like to sit in awe before something you cannot explain?
* Can you remember a time when clarity gave way to wonder? How did it change you?
