## Chapter 46 - Sophia's Seventh Repentance: Rejected and Mocked

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples:
"When Pistis Sophia finished her sixth prayer of repentance, she looked upward again, hoping to see if her sins had been forgiven and if she would finally be led out of the chaos. But the First Mystery had not yet given the command for her to be released. So her repentance was not accepted.

As she looked toward the Light, she saw the rulers of the twelve aeons laughing at her. They mocked her and rejoiced that her plea had not been heard. This grieved her deeply, and she cried out once more to the Light with her **seventh repentance**:

**Sophia’s Seventh Repentance**

1. O Light, I have turned all my strength toward you.

2. I have placed my trust in you—do not let me be ridiculed. Don’t let the rulers of the twelve aeons, who hate me, rejoice over me.

3. All who trust in you will not be shamed. Let those who stole my light stay in darkness and gain nothing from it. Let their stolen power be taken back.

4. O Light, show me your ways so I can be saved; show me the path out of this chaos.

5. Lead me in your light. Let me know that you are my savior. I will trust you always.

6. Help me, O Light, because your mercy never ends.

7. Do not hold my past ignorance against me. Save me by the great mystery of your forgiveness.

8. For you are good and sincere, O Light. That is why you will show me the way out of my mistakes.

9. My powers are fading from fear of the harsh forces of Self-Willed. But your command will draw near and teach my weakened powers your gnosis.

10. All your mysteries and knowledge are paths of salvation for those who seek your inheritance.

11. For the sake of your holy name, forgive my deep transgression.

12. To those who trust you, you give the mystery that suits them.

13. Their souls will live in the regions of the Light, and their power will inherit the Treasury of Light.

14. The Light empowers all who trust it. The name of its mystery belongs to them, and it will show them the way to the Inheritance.

15. I have always trusted the Light. It will rescue me from the snares of darkness.

16. Listen to me, O Light. Save me—they’ve stripped me of my name in the chaos.

17. I’m overwhelmed by suffering from the emanations. Save me from this darkness and my wrongdoing.

18. Look at my pain and forgive my failings.

19. Pay attention to the rulers of the twelve aeons—they hate me out of jealousy.

20. Guard my power and rescue me. Don’t leave me in this darkness—I have trusted you.

21. They’ve made me look foolish for believing in you, O Light.

22. So please, rescue my powers from the forces of Self-Willed, who continue to oppress me."

Jesus ended the reading and said:
"Now then, let anyone who is truly awake, stay awake."

Then Thomas stepped forward and said:
"My Lord, I am awake. My spirit is fully alive in me, and I am overjoyed that you’ve revealed these words. I’ve waited patiently, allowing the others to speak first, but now I wish to offer the meaning of Sophia’s seventh repentance."

**Thomas Explains the Repentance Using Psalm 24**

1. O Lord, I lift up my soul to you.

2. I have given myself to you; don’t let me be put to shame. Don’t let my enemies mock me.

3. All who wait on you will not be shamed; shame belongs to those who do evil for no reason.

4. Show me your ways, Lord, and teach me your paths.

5. Lead me in your truth and teach me—for you are my God and my savior. I will wait for you all day long.

6. Remember your mercy and your grace, O Lord. They have existed forever.

7. Forget the sins of my youth and my ignorance. Remember me with kindness, for the sake of your goodness.

8. The Lord is gracious and sincere—he teaches the humble his way.

9. He guides the gentle with justice and shows them his path.

10. All his ways are full of grace and truth for those who seek him.

11. For your name’s sake, forgive my great sin.

12. Who is the one who reveres the Lord? That one will be taught the way to choose.

13. His soul will rest in goodness, and his descendants will inherit the earth.

14. The Lord strengthens those who revere him and reveals his covenant to them.

15. My eyes are always turned to the Lord, for he pulls my feet out of every trap.

16. Look kindly on me—for I am alone and full of sorrow.

17. My troubles grow heavier; rescue me from my distress.

18. See my suffering and forgive my sins.

19. Look how many enemies I have and how they hate me unfairly.

20. Guard my soul and save me. I trust in you—don’t let me be disgraced.

21. Honest and sincere people are my companions because I wait for you, O Lord.

22. O God, save Israel from all his suffering.

**Jesus Praises Thomas**

After hearing this, Jesus said to Thomas:
"Well done, Thomas. You have spoken rightly. This is indeed the true meaning of Sophia’s seventh repentance. Truly, I tell you: every generation on Earth will bless you because I’ve revealed this to you, and you’ve understood it with a spiritual heart.

You’ve received from my Spirit, and you are now wise and enlightened. Soon I will fill you completely with the light and power of the Spirit so that from now on, you’ll understand everything I say and everything you will see.

In a little while, I will begin to speak to you of the mysteries of the height—of the ‘outside within’ and the ‘inside without.’"

### What It Means

In this chapter, we witness a profound moment of spiritual vulnerability. Sophia, having offered six previous repentances, looks upward in hope—yearning for forgiveness, longing to return to the Light. But she is not yet accepted. Her cry is met not with compassion, but with mockery from the rulers of the twelve aeons, who gloat over her rejection. This deepens her sorrow, yet it also sharpens her sincerity.

Her seventh repentance is a rich spiritual prayer—humble, persistent, and filled with faith. She pleads for guidance, for rescue from darkness, and for forgiveness rooted in the Light’s goodness and mystery. Despite being abandoned and mocked, she does not turn away. She continues to trust.

The aeons who laugh at her can be seen as voices of condemnation—both internal (shame, self-judgment) and external (society, spiritual gatekeepers). They represent forces that thrive on hierarchy, power, and the idea that some are "too fallen" to be redeemed. But Sophia defies that. She persists in faith.

This chapter mirrors the spiritual journey of many seekers. There are moments when we repent, grow, or awaken—and yet nothing seems to change. We may even be judged or rejected for trying. But like Sophia, the invitation is to stay aligned with the Light, even when the world (or our own inner critic) ridicules us.

Thomas’s interpretation from Psalm 24 reinforces that the Divine is merciful and just, guiding the sincere, forgiving the ignorant, and drawing near to the humble. Jesus affirms that those who understand and embody these truths will be blessed for generations—because they’ve become spiritually awake and receptive.

### Reflection

* Where in your life have you experienced rejection or silence after sincerely reaching for healing or forgiveness? How did you respond?
* Are there “aeons” in your life—voices of criticism, doubt, or shame—that try to convince you that you’re unworthy of the Light? How can you begin to name and disempower them?
* What does it mean to you to keep trusting the Light even when you don't feel seen or heard? How might that look in your daily spiritual practice?
