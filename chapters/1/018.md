## Chapter 18 — Mary Interprets the Work of Jesus through the Words of Isaiah

Mary said to Jesus:

“Lord, when you said, ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear,’ you were asking us to pay attention and understand the deeper meaning of your words. So let me share what I’ve come to understand.

You told us that you took away one-third of the power of the rulers who control the Aeons. You changed their influence—what we call Fate—and altered how their spheres work. You did this so that if humans try to use those old magical systems—like the ones taught by the fallen angels to commit evil and selfish acts—they won’t work anymore.

You also took power away from astrologers, fortune-tellers, and others who predict the future. Because of the changes you made, they can no longer accurately say what’s going to happen. Their knowledge has been disrupted. Now their influence switches direction every six months—they face left for a while and influence the world, then turn right and do the same.

What you did reminds me of something the prophet Isaiah said long ago. He spoke about Egypt and asked: ‘Where are your seers and astrologers now? Let them try to tell you what the Lord will do!’ He was speaking in symbols, prophesying the very thing you’ve done—taking away the rulers’ power so they can no longer predict or control what happens.

Isaiah called these rulers ‘Egypt,’ because they represent the world of matter, which is cut off from divine spirit. He said they would no longer know what the Lord would do. And that’s true, because you received light-power from the good Sabaoth, the divine being in the region of the Right, and that light is now in your physical body.

That’s why, Lord, you said, ‘Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear’—so we would recognize whose hearts are truly open to the kingdom of heaven.”

### What it means

This chapter is a spiritual unveiling of cosmic realignment. Mary, who consistently understands the deeper spiritual truths, is interpreting Jesus' teachings through the lens of ancient prophecy—in this case, the book of Isaiah.

At its core, this chapter tells us that Jesus has disrupted the powers that try to control fate, destiny, and the future. The rulers of the Aeons, often interpreted as cosmic intelligences or spiritual authorities, once had a tight grip on how events unfolded in the world. These powers were often accessed through esoteric or magical systems—especially astrology, divination, and other forms of ancient spiritual manipulation.

But Jesus interrupts this old machinery. By taking away one-third of their power, He disrupts the mechanism of control and restores human beings to a direct relationship with the Divine. No longer are we bound by rigid Fate or dependent on intermediaries to access spiritual truth.

Symbolically, this speaks to the death of external dependence—whether on astrology, institutions, or rigid spiritual systems—and the awakening of inner guidance. The shift from the rulers' power to Christ's light represents a psychological and spiritual shift: from being ruled by the unconscious patterns of the psyche, the “Fate” programmed by upbringing, culture, and fear—toward freedom born of spiritual illumination.

The metaphor of “Egypt” as matter is important. Egypt here stands for spiritual ignorance, materialism, and bondage—just as in the Exodus story. When Mary says the rulers are “Egypt,” she’s saying: they are the forces of the old world, the egoic world, the world of illusion and control. Christ is the liberator.

And when she mentions that Jesus’ body holds the light-power of Sabaoth (a high divine being of the Right), she’s affirming the mystery of the incarnation: that the Divine Light has come into the material world—not to escape it, but to transform it.

So when Jesus says, *“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear,”* it is a call to spiritual awakening. He is asking: Are you ready to listen—not just with your ears, but with your soul? Can you feel the shift from outer authority to inner illumination?

### Reflection

* Are there patterns or beliefs in your life—your own “fate”—that feel like they’ve been ruling over you? What would it mean to take back your power from them?
* Do you rely on outer systems (rules, predictions, doctrines, identities) to tell you who you are or what will happen? What would it feel like to trust the inner Light instead?
* What does it mean to you to “have ears to hear”? Where in your life is the Divine inviting you to awaken—and are you listening?
