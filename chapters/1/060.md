## Chapter 60 – The Light Powers Unite to Rescue Sophia

When Pistis Sophia spoke her thirteenth repentance, everything that had been ordained for her suffering was finally fulfilled. This was the moment the First Mystery had been waiting for since the beginning—the time had come to rescue her from the chaos and darkness. Her repentance was accepted by the First Mystery, and in response, a powerful light was sent from above to help her.

Jesus saw this light-power coming from the higher realms, sent by the First Mystery. At that moment, Jesus himself released another light-power from within. The two light-powers—one from the heights and one from within Jesus—met together and merged into a brilliant, powerful stream of light.

After saying this, Jesus asked his disciples if they understood what he was telling them.

Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said, “Yes, Lord, I understand. What you’ve described was already spoken through David in the 84th Psalm:

'Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed each other. Truth sprang up from the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.'

‘Grace’ is the light that came down from the First Mystery, who heard Sophia’s cries and had mercy on her. ‘Truth’ is the light-power that came from you, because you fulfilled the promise to save her. ‘Righteousness’ is the light from above that will now guide Sophia. And ‘peace’ is the power from you that will go into the forces of Self-Will and restore to Sophia the light they took from her—bringing peace back into her being.

‘Truth sprang up from the earth’ refers to the power that came from you when you descended into the depths of chaos. And ‘righteousness looked down from heaven’ speaks of the divine power sent from above to enter and strengthen Sophia.”

### What it means

In this chapter, the rescue of Pistis Sophia reaches a turning point. Her suffering, symbolized by her thirteen repentances, is not in vain. It brings her into alignment with the First Mystery—a divine source of order, wisdom, and compassion. At this moment, grace is sent from the heights, and truth rises from within the chaos. These two forces—one from above, one from within—join together in unity to restore her.

Sophia represents the soul—our own inner divine spark—trapped in the chaos of confusion, shame, and misaligned desires. The two light-powers signify the dual nature of healing: the help we receive from above (divine grace) and the strength we discover within ourselves (inner truth). When these forces meet, healing becomes possible. The soul is no longer at war with itself.

Mary’s interpretation using the psalms shows us that divine transformation is not new—it has always been whispered through sacred texts. The embrace of grace and truth, righteousness and peace, is the blueprint for redemption: not only being saved, but becoming whole.

### Reflection

* Where in your life do you feel caught in chaos or darkness, like Sophia?
* What might “grace from above” and “truth from within” look like in your personal healing?
* How can you open to the union of these forces to bring peace into your inner world?
