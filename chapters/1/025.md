## Chapter 25 — The Cycle of Light and the Making of Souls

Jesus said to Mary: “You’ve asked a beautiful and insightful question, Mary. Your understanding helps illuminate everything. Because of this, I will no longer hold anything back from you. I’ll speak clearly and openly to you and all the disciples.

Before I made my message known to all the rulers of the aeons, fate, and the heavenly spheres, they were each still bound to their assigned places and roles. They stayed in the order and motion that Yew, the Overseer of the Light, set for them from the beginning of time.

Then, when the right time came—according to the timing of Melchizedek, the great Receiver of the Light—he would enter into the middle of the aeons and their rulers, those bound to fate and the stars. He would collect the purified light from them. This light is what stirs them, what keeps them moving. Melchizedek would also activate the “Hastener,” a force that speeds up their motions, making their circuits spin faster. Through this action, he draws out their inner power—their breath, their tears, and even their sweat.

Melchizedek then purifies this energy and brings the light into the Treasury of the Light. Meanwhile, the servants of the rulers collect the leftover material substance from these powers. These servants shape that material into the souls of humans, animals, reptiles, wild beasts, and birds, and send them into the world.

There’s more: the watchers of the sun and moon look above and observe the patterns of the aeons, fate, and the stars. When they do, they collect light-power from these cosmic designs. They prepare this light and eventually hand it over to Melchizedek’s receivers, the Light-purifiers. But the leftover material—what remains after the light is taken—is again sent below the aeons, into the lower spheres. There it is shaped into new souls—of people, animals, reptiles, and birds—based on the cosmic patterns of those spheres. These souls are then born into the world as part of humanity and earthly life.

### What it means

This chapter describes a grand cosmic recycling process: light energy and spiritual power flow through the universe, are purified, and eventually return to the divine realm. Meanwhile, the physical and emotional remnants—the “material refuse”—become the basis for new souls entering into earthly life.

Symbolically, this speaks to the idea that our souls come from both divine light and worldly matter. We’re a mix of spirit and form, purity and struggle. The light within us is our essence—our true Self, divine and eternal. But it is housed within a body and psyche shaped by the material leftovers of past cycles: experiences, emotions, and ancestral patterns.

Melchizedek represents a divine intermediary who purifies and liberates the light from the patterns of fate and habit. The “Hastener” can be seen as a force of spiritual awakening, stirring things up so transformation can happen more quickly.

The journey of the soul into this world isn't random—it follows a pattern, a cosmic logic. Our life circumstances, tendencies, and even challenges are connected to a much larger spiritual design. Yet within it all, we carry a spark of purified light, waiting to awaken and return to its Source.

### Reflection

* What within me feels like "light"—pure, true, and eternal—and what feels like “material leftovers” that still need healing?
* Where in my life might the “Hastener” be at work—disrupting patterns to invite growth or change?
* How can I align more deeply with the divine cycle of purification and return, rather than being caught in the recycled habits of fate?
