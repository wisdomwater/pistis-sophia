## Chapter 59 - The Wreath of Light

When Pistis Sophia finished her prayer from within the chaos, Jesus transformed the light-power He had sent into a crown of light that rested on her head. From that moment on, the forces of Self-Willed could no longer control her. The light-wreath purified her completely—everything impure within her shook loose and was left behind in the chaos. The forces of Self-Willed looked at the discarded darkness and rejoiced, not realizing that their power over her had ended. Meanwhile, the pure light within Sophia was strengthened by the crown of divine light around her.

When this crown embraced her inner light, it remained with her. Her pure essence did not separate from it, and thus the powers of Self-Willed could not steal it. In this sacred union, Sophia began to praise the light that now crowned her. She sang:

1. "The Light has become a crown around my head, and I will not leave it, so that the forces of Self-Willed cannot take it from me.

2. Even if all things around me are shaken, I will remain unshaken.

3. Even if everything I once was falls apart and stays in the chaos—those things which the forces of Self-Willed still watch—I will not be destroyed.

4. For the Light is with me, and I am with the Light."

After this, Jesus invited someone to explain the deeper meaning of Sophia’s words. Mary, His mother, stepped forward and asked permission to speak. Jesus granted it, affirming her unique role and divine origin—both in matter and in light—and acknowledged her connection to Barbēlō and the Virgin of Light. He reminded her that the body He used was born from her, and that it had been purified.

Mary said, “My Lord, your light-power foretold this moment through Solomon in his nineteenth Ode:

1. The Lord is a wreath on my head, and I will not leave Him.

2. The wreath is truly woven for me; it has caused your branches to sprout within me.

3. It is not a lifeless, withering crown. You are alive on my head, and your life has blossomed in me.

4. Your fruits are full and perfect, filled with your salvation.”

When Jesus heard this, He praised His mother, saying, “Well spoken. Truly, truly, I tell you: People will call you blessed from one end of the earth to the other. For the mystery’s promise dwells within you—and through this promise, all beings on earth and in heaven will be saved. This promise is the beginning and the end.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals the moment when Sophia is finally crowned with light—an image rich with symbolic meaning. The crown, or wreath, represents enlightenment, integration, and divine protection. It is not just an ornament; it is a living seal of divine union. This marks the turning point where Sophia is no longer subject to the tormenting forces of Self-Willed—the fragmented parts of the psyche that arise from ego, pride, and separation.

Sophia's purification shows how our inner essence can be liberated when it is embraced by the light of divine love and awareness. The darkness and chaos she leaves behind are like old habits, traumas, or illusions that once defined us. Even if these parts still attract the attention of darker forces, they no longer have power over us when we are rooted in divine light.

Her song is a testimony of inner resilience: even as everything else falls apart, she remains. This is the heart of spiritual transformation—not the absence of chaos, but the unshakable presence of Light within it.

Mary, as a symbol of the Divine Feminine fully aligned with God, recognizes Sophia’s journey as part of the larger mystery of salvation. Her interpretation ties Sophia’s experience into an ancient promise, showing that this divine light is not new—it is eternal and living, blossoming within all who open themselves to it.

### Reflection

* What “chaos” in your life is ready to be left behind in the light of new understanding?
* How do you experience the presence of divine light within you—especially during difficult or dark times?
* In what ways are you being crowned or affirmed in your spiritual journey, even if others don’t see it?
