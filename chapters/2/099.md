# Chapter 99 — The Three Allotments of Light and the Reign of a Thousand Years

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and asked, “Lord, how long is one year in the realm of the Light compared to time on Earth?”

Jesus answered her, “One day in the Light is like a thousand years on Earth. So one full year of the Light equals 365,000 Earth years. I will reign for a thousand Light-years as King—ruling with the final Helper over all emanations of the Light and the perfected souls who have received the sacred mysteries.”

He continued, “You, my disciples, and everyone who receives the mystery of the Ineffable, will sit with me on my right and left, ruling as co-kings in the Light-kingdom. Those who receive the three mysteries of the Ineffable will also be kings in the kingdom, but they will reside behind you.

“Likewise, those who receive the five mysteries of the Ineffable will be behind the three, and those who receive the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery will be behind them. All who receive any mysteries from the space of the Ineffable will be kings—ranked according to the glory of the mystery they’ve received. Those with higher mysteries will dwell in higher regions; those with lower, in the lower regions—all within the Light.

“This, then, is the arrangement of the first space of the Ineffable.

“Those who receive mysteries from the second space—the space of the First Mystery—will also dwell in the Light-kingdom, arranged by the depth of the mysteries they’ve received. This is the second great allotment of the kingdom.

“And those who receive the mysteries of the third space, the outermost one, will also be in the Light, but they will dwell behind the second group, again placed according to the level of mysteries they’ve attained.

“These are the three great groupings of the Light-kingdom.

“There are many mysteries in these three allotments. You’ll find them written in the two great Books of Yew. But I will give you the greatest mysteries of each group—those that lead all of humanity into the higher realms of inheritance.

“You don’t need the lower mysteries; they are all written in the Books of Yew, which Enoch wrote while I spoke to him from the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life in Adam’s Paradise.

“When I explain the full expansion to you, I will also give you the high mysteries of these three spaces—their forms, types, symbolic codes, and seals—especially those of the outermost space. I will teach you their answers, defenses, and identifying signs.

“The second space, the one within, has no answers or signs. It only has sacred types and symbolic forms.”

## What it means

This chapter speaks in grand cosmic language, but at its heart, it presents a deeply symbolic map of the soul’s journey toward divine union.

The “three spaces” represent levels of spiritual consciousness or stages in the soul’s evolution. Those who attain deeper mysteries dwell “closer” to the divine Light—not in physical distance, but in depth of awareness and surrender. The closer one is, the more integrated their being is with divine truth, purity, and love.

The reign of “a thousand years of Light” is not about literal time but about a prolonged era of divine sovereignty—when the Light rules completely within and through those who have been perfected. This is the inner reign of Christ consciousness within the soul.

Even the idea of “ranks” in heaven is not about spiritual elitism, but about the natural unfolding of soul maturity. Those who embody deeper truths shine with greater radiance, not through competition but through fullness.

The Books of Yew, referenced here, are symbolic of inner revelation—the deep, quiet knowledge we receive when we listen closely to the Divine within. These are not mere texts, but soul-scrolls etched within our spiritual DNA.

Jesus promises to guide the disciples—and by extension, us—through the deeper levels of spiritual reality, revealing the “heads” or foundational mysteries that lead to full reintegration with the Source.

## Reflection

* Where do you sense yourself in this symbolic “kingdom”—are you seeking higher mysteries, or clinging to outer forms?
* How might you open to the “Book of Yew” within yourself—the quiet wisdom that comes from communion with Divine presence?
* In what ways are you being invited to participate in the reign of Light—within yourself, and in how you live with others?
