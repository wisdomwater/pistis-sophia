## Chapter 89 — The Vast Distances of Glory

When Mary heard Jesus say these things, she was filled with joy and said to him:

“My Lord, just how much greater is the *second Helper* compared to the *first Helper*? How far apart are they? And how much more does the second Helper shine?”

Jesus answered her, speaking in front of the other disciples:

“Truly, truly, I say to you: the second Helper is separated from the first Helper by an immense distance—beyond anything you can measure—whether by height, depth, length, or breadth. He is vastly farther away, beyond even all the ranks of angels, archangels, gods, and invisible beings.

The second Helper is also far greater in power and light. His brilliance is beyond all comparison. There’s no scale to measure the light he carries, nor his greatness—not even if you try to measure through the ranks of all divine and invisible beings.

And the same is true for the *third*, *fourth*, and *fifth* Helpers—each one is greater than the last, each shines brighter, and each is more distant, in ways that cannot be measured, even by the standards of the spiritual realms.

When their fullness (or expansion) is revealed, I will tell you what each one is like.”

### What it means

This chapter continues the theme of spiritual hierarchy—not as a system of oppression or exclusion, but as a vast unfolding of divine light and glory. Each Helper exists in a realm more radiant and expansive than the one before, so far removed from our understanding that even the highest spiritual beings can’t measure the distances between them.

Mary, always seeking deeper truth, asks with genuine awe, and Jesus honors her by giving a direct, if humbling, answer: the greatness of these beings—and the light they bear—is utterly beyond human comprehension.

What matters is not to *grasp* these realms intellectually, but to awaken to the truth that we’re part of something infinitely larger, where light continually grows and expands, always inviting us further.

### Reflection

* How do you respond to the idea that some truths are too vast to be measured or fully understood?
* Mary asks about distance and brightness—metrics of comparison. Are there places in your life where comparison opens up wonder, rather than judgment?
* What does it mean for each Helper to be “greater” or to “shine more”? Could this symbolize stages of spiritual maturity, inner clarity, or compassion?
