## Chapter 79 – Confronting the Forces of Darkness

The First Mystery continued speaking to the disciples, saying: 

“When Pistis Sophia finished her song, she turned to see if Adamas and his rulers had returned to their own realm. But she saw that they were still chasing after her. So she faced them and spoke:

1. Why are you still pursuing me? Why do you say I have no one to help me, no Light to save me from you?

2. But the Light is my defender—strong and faithful. Though it has waited until the time it promised to rescue me, that time has now come. The Light will not remain silent forever.

3. If you do not stop chasing me, the Light will rise in its full power.

4. It has already begun preparing that power—to strip away the false light within you and leave you in darkness. It is ready to take back the power you stole, and return you to the ground.”

Then Pistis Sophia looked toward the region of Adamas. She saw the darkness and chaos he had created, and also two violent, shadowy forces he had sent to drag her back into his domain. These dark beings were meant to overpower her and steal her light. Seeing them filled Sophia with fear, and she cried out to the Light once more, singing:

1. O Light, see how Adamas, the violent one, rages! He has sent out a dark force.

2. And he’s also created another chaotic realm—twice the darkness, twice the confusion—preparing it to trap me.

3. So, O Light, as he tries to cast me down and steal my light, let that chaos fall back upon him. Take his own light away.

4. Let the plan he made to steal my light be reversed. May the injustice he devised for me return to him instead.”

After she sang these words, the First Mystery invited anyone among the disciples who was wise and spiritually clear to come forward and interpret Sophia’s song.

### What it means

This chapter is a powerful depiction of a spiritual confrontation—between the soul that seeks the Light and the inner forces that wish to drag it back into confusion and despair. Sophia’s pursuers, led by Adamas, represent the persistent, oppressive patterns of thought and trauma that chase us even as we try to rise toward healing and wholeness.

Adamas is not just an external enemy; he is the archetype of inner violence—the voice of accusation, shame, and despair that says we are beyond help. His dark creations are the chaotic mental and emotional states that grow from this voice: hopelessness, fear, addiction, pride, and self-hate.

But Sophia no longer runs. She turns to face them.

This is the turning point. The soul that has been oppressed begins to stand in the truth of the Light. Sophia does not pretend the darkness isn’t real. She sees it clearly, feels its danger, but she also knows that the Light is her vindicator. She does not rely on her own strength. She trusts that the Light has a timing, a justice, and a power that will respond.

She sings not just a prayer, but a command rooted in deep trust: “Let their own plans return to them. Let their chaos consume only themselves.”

This is a sacred moment of reclaiming power—not by retaliating with violence, but by refusing to submit to the lies of darkness any longer.

### Reflection

* What inner voices or patterns still chase you, trying to drag you back into fear or despair?
* Have you ever felt like the Light was delaying—waiting too long to rescue you? How might divine timing differ from your own?
* What would it look like to turn and face your inner darkness with the strength of the Light instead of running away?
