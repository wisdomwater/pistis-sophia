## Chapter 97 — The Many Paths to the Light

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and said:

“My Lord, please be patient with me if I ask for clarity. Is the ‘word of the mystery of the Ineffable’ different from the ‘word of the whole gnosis’?”

Jesus answered:
“Yes, they are different. The mystery of the Ineffable is not the same as the complete gnosis (knowledge or understanding) of everything.”

Mary continued:
“If we don’t know the full gnosis of the word of the Ineffable, can we still enter the Kingdom of Light?”

Jesus replied:
“Yes, absolutely. Anyone who receives a mystery of the Kingdom will enter and inherit up to the level of that mystery. But only those who receive the one and only word of the Ineffable will truly understand the origin and purpose of the whole universe. I am that gnosis.

And it’s impossible to know that one word unless you’ve first received the mystery of the Ineffable. Still, everyone who receives mysteries of the Light will inherit a place in my Kingdom based on the level of mystery they’ve received.”

He explained further:
“That’s why I once said, ‘He who believes a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and he who believes a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.’ In other words, each person will rise to the level of mystery they’ve accepted. Those with lesser mysteries inherit lesser places. Those with higher mysteries inherit higher places. All will live in light and joy, each in their own region, and will have power over the levels beneath them—but not over the levels above.

Now, listen to what I say about those who receive the mysteries of the First Mystery.

If someone has received even the first of the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery and then dies, the angels who help souls will come to them. That soul will shine like a beam of pure light. The rulers of the lower realms will be terrified of its brightness and powerless to stop it. The soul will rise upward, passing through every realm of the rulers and even the realms of the Light itself—without needing to answer questions, give tokens, or explain itself.

The same goes for anyone who receives the second, third, and so on—up to the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery. Each will shine with brilliant light, rise through every realm, and rule over the territories that correspond to the level of mystery they’ve received. Those who reach the twelfth mystery will govern over all the realms of the twelve saviors.

But even those who’ve received all twelve are not equal to those who receive the one and only mystery of the Ineffable. Still, they will remain in elevated, exalted places within the realms of Light.”

### What it means

This chapter draws a distinction between different levels of spiritual understanding or enlightenment. Jesus explains that there are many layers or “mysteries” a soul may receive—each one taking the soul higher in its ability to inherit divine light and authority.

However, the highest is the one and only mystery of the Ineffable—something so profound it encompasses the very origin and design of the universe. While others may reach high regions of light, only those who receive this ultimate mystery can fully comprehend the divine totality.

At the same time, Jesus offers reassurance: All who receive any mystery will enter into light and joy. Each soul will rise according to its readiness and depth of initiation—and all will be blessed.

### Reflection

* How do you understand the idea of "receiving a mystery"? Is it about intellectual understanding, or something more intuitive and spiritual?

* What does it mean to you that “I am the gnosis of the universe”? How might Jesus be inviting us to see him—not just as a teacher, but as a living embodiment of divine wisdom?

* Do you find comfort in the idea that all souls receive according to what they are ready for? How does that shape the way you approach your own spiritual journey?
