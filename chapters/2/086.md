## Chapter 86 — The Future Order of the Light

Jesus responded to Mary and said, “You ask deep and thoughtful questions, and I’m glad to answer them with clarity. So listen carefully: I will explain to you about the end of the age and the final ascension of the universe. That moment hasn’t come yet. But I once said, ‘If I take you into the realm of those who have received the Mysteries of the Light, even the glorious Treasury of the Light will seem as small and distant as a speck of dust compared to it.’

“This will happen at the time of the great completion—when the universe rises and is fully transformed.

In that time, the twelve Saviors of the Treasury and all their emanations—who come from the seven Voices and the five Trees—will rule alongside me in the realm of Light. Each will be a king according to their own level of glory: the great will be great, the small will be small, each shining in their unique way.

Each Savior will oversee those souls who received the corresponding mystery of the First Mystery:

* The first Savior will care for souls with the first mystery.
* The second Savior will care for those with the second mystery.
* And so on, through the twelfth Savior and the twelfth mystery.

All these Saviors will continue to lead their emanations in the new realm, just as they did before, but now in the full Light.

On my right will be the Seven Amēns, the Five Trees, and the Three Amēns again—each a ruler in the Light. On my left will be the Twin Saviors (the Child of the Child) and the Nine Guards, who will also reign in Light.

The hierarchy will remain, but it will be illuminated and fulfilled:

* The Nine Guards will be greater than the Saviors,
* The Twin Saviors will be greater than the Nine Guards,
* The Three Amēns will be greater than the Twin Saviors,
* The Five Trees will be above the Three Amēns.

Also with us will be Yew (the overseer of the Light), the Guardian of the Veil, the Receiver of Light, the Two Great Guides, and the great Sabaoth (the Good, whom I have called my Father). These came from the purest Light of the Trees—each emerging from one of the Five Trees—and they are placed in charge by the First Mystery to help gather Light from all the realms and races of the universe. Because of their responsibility, they will rule alongside the first Savior in the region of those with the first mystery.

Alongside them will be the Virgin of Light, the Great Guide of the Midst (whom the lower rulers call “Great Yew”), and his twelve assistants—these are the ones from whom you received your shape and inner power. They too will reign in the realm of the first mystery.

And the fifteen helpers of the Seven Virgins of Light in the Midst will spread across the regions of the twelve Saviors. All the other angels from the Midst will each reign according to their glory, and I will reign over them all.

But none of this will happen yet. It will only happen at the very end of the age, when everything is lifted up—when the universe dissolves and the count of perfect souls is complete.

Until that time, everyone remains in their assigned place, performing the role they were given from the beginning. All—whether from the Right, the Midst, the Treasury, or even the rulers who have repented—will stay in their proper region until the full number of perfect souls is gathered.

When that happens, the souls will rise. Each will ascend when they receive the appropriate Mysteries. The rulers who repented will pass into the Midst, where they will be baptized, anointed with spirit, and sealed with the Mysteries. They will then ascend through all the levels—through the Midst, through the Right, through the regions of the Nine Guards, the Twin Saviors, the Three Amēns, the Twelve Saviors, the Five Trees, and the Seven Voices.

Each region will give them its seal, and they will pass into the Inheritance of the Light—each soul entering the level that matches the mysteries they have received.

These perfected souls will surpass all others:

* They will pass the repentant rulers,
* They will pass those of the Midst,
* They will pass those of the Right,
* They will pass even those of the Treasury of the Light and the First Commandment.

They will enter into the deepest part of the Light’s Inheritance, where they belong.

Those who serve in the various regions—Midst, Right, Treasury—will stay in their places until the final raising up of the universe, doing their assigned roles, helping seal and guide the souls who pass through.

And so, Mary, this is the full and precise answer to your question. Let anyone who has ears to hear, hear.”

### What it means

This chapter paints a vast cosmic vision of the universe as a layered temple, with each level occupied by beings of Light and purpose. Jesus affirms that everything is structured, and every being—from rulers to angels—has a role in helping perfect souls ascend through all these levels to reach the ultimate inheritance: the Divine Light itself.

The greatest honor is reserved not for the original inhabitants of the Light, but for human souls who undergo transformation by receiving the mysteries and embodying them. These perfected souls will rise even above the angels and rulers, because they’ve chosen Light in a realm of darkness and illusion.

The passage reassures us that all things are moving toward harmony, and no being—even former rulers who once opposed the Light—is excluded from the possibility of redemption.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to you to "receive the mysteries"?**
* How do you interpret the idea that human souls can surpass even angels in their journey toward the Light?**
* Do you see yourself as someone performing a sacred role in a cosmic order—even if your life seems ordinary?**
