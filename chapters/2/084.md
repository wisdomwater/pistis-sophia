## Chapter 84 — The Glory of the Twenty-Four Invisibles and the Realms of Light

Jesus answered Mary, saying:

“How can I even describe them to you? What in this world could I compare them to? There is nothing here—no region, no form, no being—that even comes close. Nothing in this world is like the heavens.

Truly, I tell you:
Each one of the twenty-four invisibles is nine times greater than all the heavens, the cosmic sphere above them, and even the twelve aeons combined—as I’ve told you before.

And as for light—no light in this world surpasses the light of the sun. But even that doesn’t come close. I tell you truly:
The twenty-four invisibles shine ten thousand times brighter than the light of the sun in this world.

Even that sun’s true form is not fully in this world—its light has passed through many veils and layers. Its true source lies in the region of the Virgin of Light, and there it shines even ten thousand times brighter than the twenty-four invisibles, the Great Invisible Forefather, and the Great Triple-Powered God.

So Mary, there is nothing here—no light, no form, no image—that can serve as a comparison for these beings. But soon I will lead you and your fellow disciples into the regions of the Height—even into the three spaces of the First Mystery (though not the Ineffable itself). And you will see their true forms, not just symbols or likenesses.

And when you see the glory of the heights, you will be amazed beyond measure.

**A Tour of Glory: Comparing the Realms**

Jesus continues:

- If I take you to the realm of the rulers of Fate, their glory will be so overwhelming that this entire world will seem like total darkness. Human life will appear like a tiny speck of dust—so far below, so small in comparison.

- If I take you to the twelve aeons, their glory will make the realm of the rulers of Fate seem like darkness too. Again, it will all appear as dust—so distant and insignificant compared to the majesty of the aeons.

- If I lead you to the thirteenth aeon, even the twelve aeons will seem like the darkness of darknesses. From there, the twelve aeons will seem no more than dust in the distance.

- If I lead you into the region of the Midst, you’ll see glory that makes even the thirteenth aeon look like dust and shadow. All the lower spheres—Fate, the cosmos, everything—will seem so far removed they vanish into nothingness.

- If I lead you to the realm of those on the Right, even the Midst will seem like nightfall on Earth. It will look like a speck of dust from that vast distance.

- If I lead you to the Light-land, the Treasury of the Light, the realm of those on the Right will look like a hazy noon sky—when the sun is hidden. And again, it will seem no more than a grain of dust from that greater distance.

- And finally, if I take you to the realm of the Inheritance, where those who received the mysteries dwell in pure Light—the Light-land itself will appear like the ordinary sun of this world. From the higher vantage, even the Treasury of the Light seems like a speck of dust, so far beneath, so small compared to the greatness of that final realm.

### What it means

This chapter is a majestic panorama—Jesus giving a tour of the cosmic spiritual hierarchy, step by step, level by level, in increasing glory.

Mary asks about the twenty-four invisibles, and Jesus doesn’t give a detailed description of their attributes. Instead, he uses a scale of comparison that leaves us breathless:
Each level of reality is exponentially more radiant, more vast, more beautiful than the one beneath it. And at each stage, the previous realm looks like *nothing*—just a speck of dust, a shadow, a flicker compared to the brilliance above.

This passage invites us into a vision of the ineffable beauty of the Divine order—one that no earthly language can fully convey. Jesus keeps saying, essentially: *“There’s nothing here to compare it to. You have to experience it to understand.”*

But most striking of all is his *promise*: “I will lead you there.” This isn’t just abstract teaching. Jesus is saying:
You will see this with your own eyes.

It’s an invitation to a journey—a spiritual ascent.

### Reflection

* When you imagine the hierarchy of Light Jesus describes, what images or feelings arise in you?
* How does this cosmic view change the way you see the world you live in now?
* Jesus doesn’t describe the twenty-four invisibles directly—he uses a series of comparisons to convey their greatness. What might that teach us about the limits of language when speaking of spiritual truths?
