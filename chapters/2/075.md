## Chapter 75 — Sophia's Struggle and the Promise of Protection

Jesus spoke to his disciples: “These are the trials Sophia has faced.

After I brought her down below the thirteenth aeon and was about to return to the Light, she said to me:

‘O Light of lights, you will leave me and go back to the Light. Tyrant Adamas will realize you are gone and see that my savior is not near. Then he and his rulers, who hate me, will come back. The Self-willed will give power to his lion-faced force. Together, they will try to overpower me and take away all my light. Without my light, I will become weak and lost again. So, O Light, my Light, please take away their power so they cannot overpower me.’

I answered her, ‘My Father who sent me has not yet told me to take their light away. But I will seal off the regions of the Self-willed and his rulers, who hate you because you trusted the Light. I will also seal the regions of Adamas and his rulers. None of them will be able to fight you until the time comes for my Father to command me to take their light away.’”

### What it means

This chapter shows the ongoing struggle Sophia faces from dark forces that want to steal her light. The “Light of lights” is the divine presence guiding and protecting her.

Tyrant Adamas and the Self-willed rulers represent parts of the psyche that resist growth — fear, ego, and inner blocks. Their “lion-faced emanation” is the powerful force of these shadows threatening to overwhelm the soul.

The promise to “seal the regions” means the divine is protecting Sophia from these forces for now. Full freedom will come in the right time, reminding us that healing unfolds according to divine timing.

Spiritually, this encourages us to trust the protective Light within, even when darkness seems strong. The Light holds space for us to grow and awaken in faith and patience.
