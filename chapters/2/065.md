## Chapter 65 — Peter Interprets the Light-Stream Through Solomon's Ode

Peter stepped forward and said to the Lord:

“My Lord, I understand the meaning of the words you just spoke. They were prophesied long ago by your light-power through Solomon, in what is now known as the *Odes of Solomon*:

1. A stream came forth and became a great wide flood.

2. It tore away all to itself and turned itself against the temple.

3. Dams and buildings could not hold it, nor could the art of them who hold the waters.

4. It was led over the whole land and laid hold of all.

5. They who were on the dry sand drank; their thirst was quieted and quenched, when the draught from the hand of the Highest was given.

6. Blessed are the ministers of that draught, to whom the water of the Lord is entrusted.

7. They have refreshed parched lips; they whose power was taken away, have gotten joy of heart and they have laid hold of souls, having poured in the breath, so that they should not die.

8. They have raised up limbs which were fallen; they have given power to their openness and light unto their eyes.

9. For they all have known themselves in the Lord and are saved through the water of Life eternal.

Peter continued:

“These words are about the great light-stream that came from you, my Lord. Let me explain:

- ‘A stream came forth and became a great wide flood’—this means your light-stream spread throughout the chaos and all the regions ruled by the emanations of Self-willed.
- ‘It tore away all to itself and turned itself against the temple’—this means it gathered back all the light-powers that had been taken from Pistis Sophia and returned them to her.
- ‘Dams and buildings could not hold it’—the dark structures of chaos, built by Self-willed, couldn’t contain or resist this light.
- ‘It was led over the whole land and laid hold of all’—when Gabriel and Michael poured the light over Pistis Sophia’s body, every part of her received it and began to shine.
- ‘They who were on the dry sand drank’—the parts of Sophia that had been emptied of their light were filled again.
- ‘Their thirst was quieted and quenched’—the hunger and longing of her powers ended as they were restored.
- ‘The draught from the hand of the Highest was given’—this light came from you, the First Mystery, and was a gift from the Highest.
- ‘Blessed are the ministers of that draught’—Gabriel and Michael were faithful servants, entrusted with the light, who gave it back to Sophia.
- ‘They have refreshed parched lips’—they didn’t keep anything for themselves; they restored Sophia completely.
- ‘They whose power was taken away, have gotten joy of heart’—all the powers in Sophia that were not stolen also rejoiced, receiving light from their companions who had been healed.
- ‘They have quickened souls… so that they should not die’—Sophia’s very body and essence, which had been near death, was revived.
- ‘They have raised up limbs which were fallen’—the light revived all parts of her that were close to dissolving.
- ‘They have given light unto their eyes’—they regained awareness and vision in the Light.
- ‘They all have known themselves in the Lord’—all her powers recognized each other and remembered their divine origin.
- ‘They are saved through the water of Life eternal’—the light-stream is the living water that saved them.
- ‘The light-stream tore all to itself and drew it over the temple’—after restoring Sophia, the light-stream returned to you, the true temple of Light.”

When Peter finished speaking, the First Mystery said:
“Well said, blessed Peter. This is indeed the correct interpretation of the words spoken by my light-power through the Ode of Solomon.”

### What it means

This chapter is a powerful moment of recognition. Peter, often the one who struggles to understand, now speaks with clarity and insight, interpreting a sacred text as a reflection of the divine work unfolding before them.

He quotes the *Odes of Solomon*, one of the earliest Christian hymns of mystical devotion, and explains how the light-stream sent to rescue Pistis Sophia fulfills these poetic words. In doing so, Peter affirms that the mission of Christ, the First Mystery, was always written into the deeper currents of divine wisdom.

The metaphors of water—flood, thirst, refreshment, breath—speak to the healing and life-giving nature of divine grace. The “water of Life eternal” is the light itself, restoring the soul’s true nature. It quenches the soul's longing, revives what was perishing, and reveals the interconnectedness of all spiritual powers.

This is a vision of salvation not as a transaction, but as reunion and remembrance: each part of Sophia recognizing itself again in the Light, remembering it belongs to the Divine.

### Reflection

* Have you ever experienced a moment of deep clarity where something ancient or poetic suddenly made sense in your personal life?
* In your own spiritual journey, what has the “living water” looked like? Where have you felt revived after a long inner drought?
* Peter’s role here reminds us that understanding grows over time. Can you think of any truth that first felt confusing but later made sense?
