## Chapter 74 — Sophia Receives a New Mystery and Is Lifted Up

After Sophia’s previous song, the First Mystery addressed the disciples:

“Who among you understands the meaning of her words? Let them speak openly.”

Mary stepped forward again and said:

“My Lord, these words are what your light-power once prophesied through David in *Psalm 103*:

1. ‘My soul, praise the Lord, and let all that is within me praise his holy name.

2. My soul, praise the Lord, and forget not all his kindnesses.

3. Who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases;

4. Who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with grace and compassion;

5. Who satisfies your soul with good things; your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.’

This means: Sophia will be like the invisible beings in the Heights. The eagle is used because it dwells high above, just like the invisibles. Sophia will shine again as she did in the beginning.”

The First Mystery replied:

“Well said, Mary—blessed one.”

Then the First Mystery said:

“I took Pistis Sophia and lifted her to a region just below the thirteenth æon. There I gave her a new mystery of the Light, different from the one of her old realm—the place of the invisibles.

I also gave her a song of the Light, so that no ruler of the æons could overpower her again. I placed her there safely, where she would wait until I come to bring her into her higher region.”

**Sophia’s New Song**

Once in her new place, Sophia sang again:

1. “In faith, I have trusted the Light. It remembered me and listened to my cry.

2. It led my power out of the chaos and the deep shadows of matter. It lifted me into a higher, firmer aeon. It changed my path toward my true region.

3. It gave me a new mystery—one not of my old aeon—and a song of the Light. Now all the rulers will see what you, O Light, have done for me. They will be afraid and believe in the Light.”

Sophia sang this rejoicing, knowing she had been lifted from chaos to a more secure place—close to, but not yet within, the thirteenth aeon.

**Andrew’s Interpretation**

The First Mystery again invited interpretation. Andrew stepped forward and said:

“This is what your light-power prophesied through David in *Psalm 40*:

1. ‘I waited patiently for the Lord. He heard me and listened to my cry.

2. He lifted my soul out of the pit of misery, out of the slimy clay. He set my feet on a rock and made my path straight.

3. He put a new song in my mouth—a song of praise to our God. Many will see it, be afraid, and trust in the Lord.’”

The First Mystery said:

“Well said, Andrew—blessed one.”

### What it means

Sophia’s journey has reached a new stage: *restoration and empowerment*. She has not yet returned to her original home, but she is no longer in chaos. She has been given a new mystery—a new level of understanding and power—and a song that protects her and reveals her transformation.

The metaphors are striking:

* “Renewed like an eagle” – she soars again in the spiritual heights.
* “A new song in my mouth” – she’s no longer repeating her old laments; she has a new identity, a new voice.
* “Placed on a rock” – her steps are now secure.

Importantly, her experience becomes a witness to others. The rulers will “see and be afraid and believe.” Sophia’s redemption testifies to the Light’s power not just to save, but to transform and elevate.

### Reflection

* What “new song” might you be called to sing after a season of chaos or descent?
* Are you still clinging to an “old mystery”—a way of seeing or being that no longer fits where you are?
* Can you feel a shift from merely surviving to becoming a witness—someone whose story reveals divine renewal?
