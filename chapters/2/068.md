## Chapter 68 – Sophia's Song of Deliverance

When the First Mystery heard these words, he said, “Well spoken, James, my beloved.”

Then the First Mystery continued speaking to his disciples:

“When I brought Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, she lifted her voice in praise and sang this song:

1. I have been rescued from the chaos and set free from the chains of darkness. I have come into your Light.

2. You were Light all around me—saving me, lifting me up.

3. The dark forces of Self-Willed tried to overpower me, but your Light stopped them. They couldn’t come near me, because your Light surrounded and protected me.

4. Those dark forces had stripped me of my power and thrown me into the chaos, leaving me without Light. I became as heavy as dead weight compared to them.

5. But then, your Light reached me—it shone from every direction and completely surrounded me, so no part of me was left in darkness.

6. Your Light washed over me and cleared away all the darkness within. I’m being freed from all that burden because of your Light.

7. Your Light has lifted me up. It removed the grip of those who tried to overpower me.

8. Now I fully trust your Light. I have become pure through your shining presence.

9. The forces of Self-Willed have fled from me. I now shine with your great power—for you are the one who saves eternally.”

This is the prayer of gratitude that Pistis Sophia spoke when she was freed from chaos and unbound from its chains. Let all who can hear, truly listen.

### What it means

This chapter is a beautiful hymn of liberation. Sophia, the soul, has been trapped in darkness—abandoned and heavy, stripped of light. This chaos symbolizes the inner state of despair, shame, confusion, and false belief that weighs us down when we become disconnected from our Divine Source. The “Self-Willed” forces represent the ego’s attempts to dominate through pride, control, and separation.

But the Light—symbol of divine grace, truth, and healing presence—reaches her. It doesn’t just shine *on* her, it surrounds her, penetrates her, and purifies her. She is made whole not through her own strength, but by fully surrendering to the Light. She becomes light-filled, no longer just reaching for it, but embodying it.

This is the path of spiritual transformation. When we are in our darkest moments, it can feel like there is no way out. Yet even in the deepest chaos, the Light is present, waiting to be received. As we open to it, allow it to cleanse us, and trust it more deeply, we begin to rise. What once bound us falls away. And we become radiant with the very Light that saved us.

### Reflection

* In what areas of your life do you feel stuck or weighed down by chaos?
* How can you allow the Light to surround and heal you—without needing to “fix” yourself first?
* What would it feel like to fully trust the Light within you, even when things still seem dark?
