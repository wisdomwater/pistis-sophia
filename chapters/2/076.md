# Chapter 76 — The Sign of Sophia's Final Deliverance

Jesus said to Sophia, “Listen, I will tell you about the time when what I said will happen. It will happen when the ‘three times’ are finished.”

Sophia asked, “O Light, how will I know when these three times are complete? I want to rejoice because that means you will bring me back to my home. And I will be glad because the time will come when you will take away the light-power from those who hate me, since I have trusted your Light.”

I answered, “You will know when you see the left gate of the Treasury of the Great Light open after the thirteenth aeon. When that gate opens, the three times will be finished.”

Sophia said, “But I am here now, in this place. How will I know when that gate is opened?”

I told her, “When that gate opens, everyone in all the aeons will see the Great Light shining in their realms. I have arranged that no one will harm you until the three times are done. You will have the power to move through the twelve aeons below and return to your region beneath the thirteenth aeon, where you are now.

But you will not be able to pass through the gate of the Height in the thirteenth aeon to return to where you first came from.

When the three times are finished, Self-willed and his rulers will again try to overpower you and take your light. They will be angry because they think you trapped their power in chaos and stole its light. Adamas will try this too.

But I will take their powers away from them and give them to you. I will come to help you. So if they try to capture you, praise the Light, and I will quickly come to your aid. I will come to the regions below you and take their light away. I will bring you back to your true home.”

When Sophia heard this, she rejoiced greatly. But I brought her back to the region below the thirteenth aeon. Then I returned to the Light and left her there.

Jesus told the disciples all these adventures so they would understand what would happen to Sophia. He sat on the Mount of Olives and spoke of these things. He said, “While I was with you here on the Mount of Olives, before I received my second vesture from the Height, the time had come for what I told Sophia: that Adamas and his rulers would try to overpower her.”

## What it means

This chapter reveals a crucial moment in Sophia’s journey — the sign that marks her final deliverance and return to the Light. The “three times” represent a divine period of testing and purification, a necessary process in the soul’s awakening.

The “left gate of the Treasury of the Great Light” symbolizes a spiritual threshold. When it opens, it signals a powerful shift of Light spreading through all the realms of consciousness, awakening awareness everywhere.

Sophia’s limited freedom to travel within the lower aeons but not yet beyond the thirteenth shows how the soul can move within many layers of its inner world but must wait patiently before fully returning to its divine origin.

The renewed attack from Self-willed and Adamas reflects the final inner battles the soul faces with ego, fear, and resistance before liberation. The promise of divine help reminds us that no matter how fierce the struggle, the Light is always present to support us.

Devotionally, this is a call to trust the unfolding divine plan and to find joy in the signs of spiritual progress, even when the path is difficult. It teaches patience, faith, and praise for the Light’s protection and guidance.

* How do you recognize the signs that new light and awakening are coming in your life?
* When you face inner battles, how can you invite the Light to help you and keep trusting its timing?
