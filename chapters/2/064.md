# Chapter 64 — The Light Restored to Sophia

The First Mystery continued speaking and said:

“When I came down from the Heights—sent by my Father to rescue Pistis Sophia from the chaos—I brought with me a power, and also the soul I had received from Sabaoth the Good. These three—myself, the power, and the soul—merged into one radiant stream of Light.

By the command of my Father, the First Mystery who looks within, I called down the angels Gabriel and Michael from the heavenly realms. I gave them the light-stream and sent them into the chaos to help Pistis Sophia. Their task was to retrieve the light-powers that the forces of Self-willed had stolen from her, and to return them to her.

As soon as Gabriel and Michael brought the light-stream into the chaos, it shone with overwhelming brilliance. Its radiance spread through all the regions of chaos. When the emanations of Self-willed saw this great light, they were filled with fear. The light-stream drew out of them all the light-powers they had taken from Pistis Sophia. They could not hold onto it, nor could they resist it using the powers of Self-willed.

Then Gabriel and Michael carried the light-stream over the material form of Pistis Sophia and poured all her stolen light back into her. Her entire being began to shine. Every power within her that had been darkened by the loss of its light was restored. They received back their light through me.

Gabriel and Michael, who had been entrusted with this mission, gave no light to themselves; they returned everything to Sophia. These two angels will also give her the mysteries of the Light, as I have appointed them.

When the light-stream had fully restored all of Sophia’s stolen light-powers, she became radiant once more. The parts of her that had not been stolen also became joyful and were filled with light. The light brought new life to her body—the parts of her that had nearly died or perished were revived. All her powers were raised up again and reconnected with their true nature.

Through my light-stream, all the powers in her recognized each other and were saved.

Once the light-stream had completed its mission—restoring all that had been taken—it returned from the chaos and ascended again.

After sharing this, the First Mystery asked the disciples, ‘Do you understand how I am speaking to you?’”

## What it means

This chapter is a radiant image of spiritual restoration.

Pistis Sophia, the soul that descended into chaos, represents each of us when we lose connection with the divine light—when we are overwhelmed by forces of fear, ego, and confusion (symbolized by the emanations of Self-willed). She suffers, becomes fragmented, and her inner powers—her light—are scattered or stolen.

But this is not the end. The Light does not abandon her. The Christ, as the divine emissary, unites with the soul and brings forth a redeeming stream of light—an intervention from the divine realm. This light is not just power; it is mercy, healing, and reunion.

Gabriel and Michael, symbols of divine messengers and protectors, serve not to dominate but to restore. They return to Sophia what is truly hers—not adding anything foreign, but bringing back what was lost.

The story is a profound metaphor for healing from trauma, regaining inner unity, and being restored to wholeness. When we receive divine light—whether through grace, love, wisdom, or deep spiritual insight—what was nearly dead within us revives. Powers within us that were hidden, broken, or confused suddenly remember who they are. They "know each other again"—a symbol of inner harmony, self-recognition, and integration.

This is not a story only of rescue—it is a story of return, of light making us whole, and of how the divine never stops seeking to restore what belongs to the Light.

## Reflection

* What parts of your soul feel like they’ve been lost in “chaos”? What would it mean for them to be restored?
* Can you recognize moments in your life where divine help came—perhaps through others or inner clarity—to bring back something you thought was gone?
* In what ways can you become like Gabriel or Michael for someone else—helping them reclaim their light without taking any for yourself?
