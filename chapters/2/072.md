# Chapter 72 — Mary Interprets Sophia's Next Song

After Matthew finished interpreting Sophia’s previous song, the First Mystery responded:

“Well spoken, Matthew—beautifully done, beloved. That *is* the true interpretation of the song Pistis Sophia has sung.”

Then the First Mystery continued, revealing more words that Sophia had spoken:

**Sophia’s Continued Song**

1. “I will declare: You are the higher Light, for you have saved me and brought me to yourself. You did not allow the emanations of Self-Willed, who are hostile to me, to take my light.

2. O Light of lights, I sing praises to you; you have saved me.
3. O Light, you have lifted my power from the chaos; you rescued me from those who fell into darkness.”

The First Mystery then said to the disciples:

“Let the one whose mind has become enlightened and who understands these words come forward and offer their interpretation.”

At this, Mary Magdalene stepped forward—hesitant but willing. She said:

“My Lord, I always understand the words and I am ready to interpret them. But I’m afraid of Peter—he threatened me and despises women.”

The First Mystery replied:

“Anyone who is filled with the Spirit of Light and wants to speak, no one can stop them. So Mary, go ahead and share the interpretation.”

Then Mary spoke, saying:

“My Lord, concerning Sophia’s words, your Light once prophesied them long ago through David, in *Psalm 29*:

1. ‘I will exalt you, O Lord, for you have lifted me up, and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.

2. O Lord, my God, I cried to you, and you healed me.

3. O Lord, you brought my soul up from the underworld; you saved me from those going down to the pit.’”

## What it means

This brief chapter shows Sophia continuing to sing her gratitude to the Light for rescuing her from the dark forces. Her song now shifts from desperation to praise. She recognizes that the Light not only saved her but *did not let her enemies succeed*. There is joy and relief here—a sacred declaration of having been *truly delivered*.

Once again, her words echo earlier scripture. Mary draws from Psalm 29 to interpret Sophia’s song, connecting Sophia’s descent and salvation with David’s own cry for deliverance. The link between ancient Hebrew scripture and this Gnostic text is clear: both express a journey from near destruction to divine healing and redemption.

But the emotional weight of this chapter comes from Mary Magdalene’s vulnerability. She understands the message and is ready to speak—but she hesitates out of fear. Peter’s threat and his disdain for women weigh on her. This moment captures the tension between divine calling and human oppression. The First Mystery (representing the Divine) reassures her: anyone filled with light has the *right* to speak, regardless of status, gender, or the opinions of others.

In doing so, this chapter quietly upholds a radical truth: divine insight is not bound by earthly hierarchies.

## Reflection

* Have you ever felt ready to share something meaningful but held back because of fear or rejection?
* What might change in your life if you trusted that divine truth in you *deserves* to be spoken?
* How does Mary’s courage to speak—despite the threat of being silenced—resonate with your own journey?
