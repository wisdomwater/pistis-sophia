# Chapter 78 — A Cry for Justice and Deliverance

After the First Mystery finished speaking to the disciples, he invited them to come forward if they had understood his words and could explain their meaning.

James stepped forward and said, “My Lord, the song that Pistis Sophia sang was actually foretold long ago through your light-power in the words of David in the seventh Psalm. Here is the connection:

1. O Lord my God, I have placed all my hope in you. Rescue me from those who chase me and save me.

2. Don’t let them tear my soul apart like a lion, with no one to defend me or set me free.

3. O Lord my God, if I’ve done wrong, if there is guilt on my hands—

4. If I’ve harmed those who were good to me—then let me be defeated and fall into the hands of my enemies.

5. Let them hunt me down, destroy my life, and throw my honor in the dirt.

6. But rise up, Lord, in your righteous anger! Stand against my enemies and bring their schemes to an end.

7. Act now, just as you promised in your commandment.”

After James finished, the First Mystery replied, “Well said, James, my beloved.”

## What it means

In this brief but rich chapter, James connects Pistis Sophia’s lament to Psalm 7—a cry of desperation and a plea for divine justice. This is more than just a quote from scripture; it’s a deep recognition that Sophia’s struggle is mirrored in the inner life of every soul seeking liberation from darkness.

Symbolically, Sophia’s cry reflects the human psyche in its moments of deepest vulnerability. When we are caught in guilt, shame, or despair—when the “pursuers” of fear, regret, or trauma close in—it feels as if we are being torn apart from within, like a lion seizing its prey. These internal enemies seem unstoppable, and we feel powerless to deliver ourselves.

Yet even in that powerlessness, there is a cry—a hope—that divine justice still lives. The Psalm acknowledges the soul’s responsibility: “If I have done wrong…” But it also affirms that the soul can turn to the Divine Light, not with excuses, but with humility and trust. God’s wrath here is not destructive anger but a powerful force that brings balance, truth, and healing.

Sophia's song, like the Psalm, becomes a mirror for our own inner prayers. It invites us to be honest about our struggles, to take responsibility for what we have done, and yet to cry out boldly for deliverance, knowing that the Light does not abandon the soul that longs to return.

## Reflection

* What “pursuers” in your inner life feel like lions threatening to devour your peace?
* In what ways might you need to take responsibility before calling out for help?
* How can you trust that divine justice is not about punishment, but about restoring your soul to wholeness?
