## Chapter 83 — Mary Asks About the Nature of the Twenty-Four Invisibles

After all this had taken place, Mary came forward again. She knelt before Jesus, honoring him, and said:

“My Lord, please don’t be angry with me for asking questions. You’ve told us before, *‘Seek and you shall find; knock and the door will be opened. For everyone who seeks will find, and to everyone who knocks, it shall be opened.’* 

So, who should we seek? At whose door should we knock? Who else but you can give us answers about the mysteries we ask? Who else understands the power of these words we seek to grasp?

You’ve given us minds awakened by the Light, filled us with understanding and high thoughts. And because of this, there is no one in the world or even in the highest aeons who can truly answer our questions—except you, the One who knows and is complete in all things.

We’re not asking in the way worldly people ask. We are asking in the spirit of gnosis, in the wisdom of the Heights that you have shared with us. We ask with the kind of deep and excellent inquiry you’ve taught us to use. So, my Lord, don’t be upset with me—please reveal what I’m about to ask.”

When Jesus heard Mary Magdalene speak these words, he responded:

“Ask what you want to ask, and I will reveal it to you clearly and completely. Truly, truly, I say to you: rejoice and be exceedingly glad! If you ask everything with care and precision, then I, too, will rejoice exceedingly—because you are asking in the way that is right and worthy.

So, ask freely, and I will reveal what you seek with joy.”

Mary was overjoyed when she heard this. Her heart rejoiced and she said to Jesus:

“My Lord and Saviour, tell me:  
What are the twenty-four invisibles like?  
What kind of beings are they?  
What is the nature or quality of their light?”

### What it means

This chapter opens a new dialogue, returning us to one of the key spiritual voices in the Pistis Sophia: Mary Magdalene. Her approach is reverent but bold. She reminds Jesus of his own teaching—that seekers should keep seeking, knockers should keep knocking—and shows us what it looks like to *truly* seek wisdom.

Mary doesn’t ask out of idle curiosity. She knows that the mysteries of the universe are not meant to be guessed at, but carefully unveiled, and she trusts Jesus as the only one truly capable of revealing what’s beyond both the world and the heavens.

This chapter is also a beautiful picture of divine permission—Jesus welcomes questioning. He doesn’t see it as doubt or disobedience, but as joy. To question deeply, carefully, and spiritually is not only permitted, it’s *celebrated*. He rejoices when we seek truth with precision.

Mary’s question about the “four-and-twenty invisibles” (spiritual beings who surround the divine throne) marks a turning point. We’re about to move from Sophia’s personal story to a deeper cosmological teaching—a glimpse into the very architecture of the divine realms.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to you that Jesus rejoices when we ask questions?
* Have you ever felt like your desire to understand was discouraged by religious authorities? How might this chapter offer a healing alternative?
* Mary asks about the *nature* and *light* of divine beings—not just *what* they are but *how* they are. What kind of beings do you imagine when you think of higher spiritual intelligences?
