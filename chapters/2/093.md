# Chapter 93 — The Mystery Behind All Things

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples and said:

“Again, my disciples, my companions, my brothers—stay awake in your spirits and truly pay attention to what I tell you. For now I begin to speak of the full knowledge—the total gnosis—of the mystery of the Ineffable.”

This great Mystery knows the origins and purpose of everything:

* Why the west and the east came to be.
* Why the north and south came to be.
* Why demons arose, and why humankind did too.
* Why heat and pleasant air, stars and clouds, land and sea, famine and abundance arose.

It understands both extremes:

* Why frost and dew, dust and freshness, hail and snow exist.
* Why winds from every direction arose.
* Why heavenly fire and waters, stars, planets, and the firmament came to be.

The Mystery knows:

* Why the cosmic rulers and their realms, including the aeons, their veils, and even the tyrant rulers arose—and why some of them repented.
* Why servants, decan rulers, angels, archangels, lords, and gods arose.

It understands inner dynamics too:

* Why jealousy and harmony, hatred and love, greed and generosity, appetite and satisfaction, impiety and fear of God came into being.

It knows why:

* The light-givers and sparks, the thrice-powerful beings, the invisibles, the forefathers, and the pure ones arose.
* Why the great Self-Willed appeared, along with his followers.
* Why the Triple-Powerful One and the Invisible Forefather arose.
* Why the Thirteenth Aeon, the region of the Midst, its receivers, virgins, ministers, and angels came to be.

It even knows:

* Why the light-land exists, why the great receiver of the light, the guardians, leaders, and gate of life arose.
* Why Sabaoth the Good, the region of the Right, the treasury of the light, the twelve saviors, the three gates, the nine guards, the twin saviors, the three Amēns, the five Trees, and the seven Amēns arose.

And finally:

* This Mystery even knows why Mixture—that strange force which "existeth not"—came into being, and why it is now being purified.

## What it means

This chapter brings the reader to a kind of cosmic climax. Jesus is painting a picture of a universe entirely infused with divine purpose, even in its most arcane and metaphysical parts.

The repetition is intentional—this is not just a list, it’s a mantra of wholeness. Every force, every being, every direction, every emotion, every metaphysical realm is included. And the Mystery of the Ineffable knows why it all exists.

This chapter expresses an idea similar to mystical traditions around the world: that divine consciousness is not limited to heaven or good things. It’s present even in demons, tyrants, jealousy, and famine—not to justify those things, but to show that they are not outside divine knowing. Even what appears chaotic or evil has a reason for being—and even these will be transformed, repented, or purified.

The ending reference to the “Mixture which existeth not” refers to a Gnostic idea: that the material world is a mixture of light and darkness, spirit and matter, illusion and truth—and that the spiritual journey involves separating the light from the dark, a purification process that leads us home.

## Reflection

* What would it mean to live your life trusting that *everything* has a reason—even things that appear meaningless, chaotic, or painful?
* When you look around your life—your body, relationships, struggles—do you believe there is a divine Mystery that understands all of it?
* What do you feel when you hear that even things like jealousy, tyranny, or demons are *known* and *accounted for* in the great scheme of things?
