## Chapter 94 — Losing Heart Before the Mystery

Jesus continued speaking to his disciples:

"Still more, my disciples—stay grounded. Let each of you gather the strength to sense the Light within you, so that you can perceive it clearly. For from this moment on, I will begin to speak to you about the true nature of the region of the Ineffable, and how it truly is."

But when the disciples heard this, they faltered. The gravity of his words overwhelmed them, and they lost heart.

Then Mary Magdalene stepped forward. She fell at Jesus’ feet, kissed them, and wept. Through her tears, she cried:

"Have mercy on me, Lord. My brothers have heard your words and they’ve become discouraged. Just now, you said you would begin to speak about the full knowledge of the mystery of the Ineffable. But you haven’t finished explaining what you meant. That’s why they’ve lost their focus and stopped trying to understand.

You said that everything you’ve told us is part of the mystery of the Ineffable. But if that’s true—if it’s all hidden within that one vast mystery—how could anyone on earth possibly have the ability to understand it? Who could ever grasp the fullness of such a thing?"

### What it means

This chapter captures a deeply human moment. As Jesus prepares to reveal something profound—the very nature of the Ineffable—it becomes too much for the disciples. They "let go" emotionally, spiritually. The mystery seems too vast, too overwhelming. They lose their grip.

And it's Mary Magdalene who once again becomes the voice of honest questioning and heartfelt longing. She doesn’t pretend to understand. She weeps. She pleads. And she brings forward the real fear: *How can anyone possibly understand something so infinite?*

This moment teaches us that divine truths can sometimes be too much for the mind—but not for the heart. While the others fall silent, it is Mary who dares to speak, not from certainty, but from love and longing. She embodies the humility and openness that allow a person to receive what the intellect alone cannot grasp.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the mystery of life, the universe, or God? What helped you stay grounded in those moments?
* What part of you—mind, heart, body, soul—do you rely on when the truth seems too big to understand?
* Mary’s courage came from love, not certainty. Where in your life could you let love guide your questions instead of needing all the answers?
