## Chapter 100 – The Refuse That Becomes Light

After Jesus had finished speaking, Andrew approached and said humbly, “Lord, please have mercy. I don’t understand something and it’s troubling me—how can people, still in bodies of matter, possibly pass through the firmaments, rulers, gods, and the great invisibles to enter the Kingdom of Light?”

Jesus was stirred deeply and exclaimed, “How long must I bear with you? Don’t you understand that *all*—you, angels, archangels, rulers, lords, invisibles, the Midst, the Right, and even the great emanations of the Light—come from the same substance? You’re all made from the same Mixture.”

He continued: “At the command of the First Mystery, this Mixture was constrained, and through necessity—not by their own effort—the emanations of the Light gradually purified themselves from the Mixture. They did not suffer. They weren’t forced into different bodies or states. They stayed in their realms and remained untainted.

“But you—you are the refuse of that entire process. You are the leftover substance of the Light’s purification. And you’ve been through immense suffering: poured into body after body, struggling through affliction. But you fought, you searched, you renounced the world and its illusions. You did not stop until you discovered the purifying Mysteries of the Light, which turned you into refined, luminous beings.”

Then Jesus declared: “That’s why I said, ‘Seek, and you will find.’ It’s not just a teaching—it’s the path itself. You sought the Mysteries that cleanse the material body and transform it into purified Light.

“Amen, I tell you: For the sake of humanity, I tore myself apart and came into the world to offer you the Mysteries. Humanity is the residue of all matter, and without the Mysteries, no soul could return to the Light.

“The Light’s emanations don’t need the Mysteries—they’re already pure. But humanity does. That’s why I said: ‘The healthy don’t need a physician, but the sick do.’ It’s the same with souls. The pure don’t need salvation—but the world is full of sick matter and sick souls.

“So announce to all people: Never stop seeking, day or night, until you find the purifying Mysteries. Say to them: Renounce the world and its distractions. Buying, selling, eating, drinking, and attaching yourself to its ways only add more matter to your soul.

“Let them know: The world is built of refuse, and everything in it weighs the soul down. If you keep feeding that, it’s harder to rise. But if you reject it and seek the Light, you’ll find the path that purifies you.”

Jesus then turned to Andrew and the disciples: “Because you’ve endured so much—being poured from form to form, suffering in every realm—and still chose to seek the Mysteries, you have now become purified Light. You will ascend through all realms and be kings in the Light-kingdom forever.”

And then he said something stunning:

“When you pass through the realms of the rulers, they will be ashamed. Because you are made from their refuse—and yet you’ve become purer than they are.  

Even the Great Invisible Ones will honor you, because you have turned base matter into glorious Light. All realms will praise you as you ascend to the Kingdom.”

When Jesus finished, the disciples were overwhelmed. They wept, bowed at his feet, and said, “Lord, forgive Andrew for not knowing.”

Jesus replied, “I forgive him—and I will forgive all. That is why the First Mystery sent me: to forgive everyone.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals the heart of Gnostic transformation: that the very refuse of the cosmos—the “leftovers” of spiritual creation—can be redeemed and exalted higher than the original emanations of Light.

Andrew’s question is honest: *How could flawed, embodied humans possibly transcend all cosmic powers?* Jesus answers that this is precisely the mystery. Humans are made from the lowest dregs, but by struggle, suffering, and seeking, they become even more pure than the spiritual powers who never had to descend.

It’s not about being chosen—it’s about choosing. Choosing to renounce the illusory world. Choosing to seek the Light no matter how lost or broken we feel. The Mysteries Jesus refers to are not only initiatory rites—they are ways of being, inward transformations that purify the soul through love, devotion, and surrender.

Even the high spiritual beings will stand in awe of those who have suffered deeply and still found the Light.

### Reflection

* Have you ever seen yourself as “refuse”? How does it feel to imagine even that being transformed into Light?
* What parts of you life still cling to the “matter” of the world—attachments, worries, illusions?
* In what ways are you being called to *seek day and night* for the inner Mysteries that purify and liberate?
