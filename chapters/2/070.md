## Chapter 70 — Sophia's Second Song of Praise

When the First Mystery heard Thomas’ explanation, he responded:

“Well done, Thomas, blessed one. That is the true interpretation of the song Pistis Sophia sang.”

Then the First Mystery continued speaking to the disciples:

“And after that, Pistis Sophia sang another song of praise to me, saying:

1. I sing to you, for by your command you led me down from the high aeon above, and you have led me back up from the lower regions.

2. And again by your command, you saved me from those lower regions. Through you, I was able to retrieve the matter from my light-powers that had been lost, and I saw it clearly.

3. You scattered far from me the emanations of Self-Willed, who oppressed and attacked me. You gave me the power to free myself from the bonds of the emanations of Adamas.

4. You struck down the seven-headed basilisk and cast it away through my own hands. You lifted me above its matter and destroyed it, so its seed could no longer rise again.

5. You were with me, giving me strength in everything. Your Light surrounded me in every place, and through you, the emanations of Self-Willed lost all their power.

6. You took the light they had stolen and returned it, straightening the path for me to escape the chaos.

7. You lifted me out of the material darkness and reclaimed all my powers that had been drained of light.

8. You filled those powers and all the parts of me that lacked light with pure Light from the highest realm.

9. You straightened the path for all my limbs, and the light of your face became for me a life that cannot die.

10. You raised me above the region of chaos and destruction so that all the dark matter within it could be released, and my powers made new in your Light, your Light filling them all.

11. You poured the light of your living stream into me, and I have become pure Light.”

“This is the second song that Pistis Sophia sang. If any of you understands its meaning, let them step forward and explain it.”

### What it means

This second song of Sophia is a triumphant hymn of resurrection. No longer begging or lamenting, Sophia now sings in gratitude, recognizing the full arc of her journey—from descent into darkness to her restoration in the Light. She acknowledges the Divine not only as Savior but as Companion, Guide, and Empowerer.

She names the forces she overcame: Self-Willed powers, Adamas, and the seven-headed basilisk—symbols of spiritual pride, material entrapment, and overwhelming chaos. Yet rather than destroy these with vengeance, she is *raised above* them. Her triumph is not in domination, but transformation.

A key moment is when Sophia says, *“You poured the light of your stream into me, and I have become pure Light.”* This signals complete reintegration. She is no longer just *rescued*—she is *reborn*. Her powers, once drained and imprisoned, are now filled with light and made whole.

Theologically and psychologically, this song represents the soul’s full awakening. After we’ve faced our shadow and cried out in need, there comes a time to rise—not just out of suffering, but into purpose and praise. Sophia’s limbs now shine with divine light; her path is straightened; her being is eternal.

This is the story not just of an individual soul, but of the Divine Feminine redeemed and elevated. Sophia’s praise becomes the soul’s natural state after healing: a life made luminous through union with the Light.

### Reflection

* What in your life once felt like chaos, but now reveals a path of transformation?
* How do you experience the Divine—not just as rescuer, but as a constant companion?
* Can you imagine a time when your very being will sing with gratitude, having become Light itself?
