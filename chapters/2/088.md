# Chapter 88 — The Glory Beyond Understanding

After Jesus had finished his earlier words, he continued speaking to his disciples:

“Listen now, and I’ll tell you about the glory of the beings from the Heights—those of the highest realms—as I’ve been teaching you all along.

Let’s say I take you to the region of the *last Helper*, the one who surrounds the Treasury of the Light. If you were to see the glory of this Helper—how radiant and powerful he is—then even the Inheritance of the Light (which seems so magnificent now) would appear to you only about as impressive as a city on Earth. That’s how great and full of light the last Helper is.

And that’s just the beginning. There are Helpers even *above* this one. I’ll describe the one directly above the last Helper to you later. But when it comes to the beings *beyond* all the Helpers, I can’t even describe them to you. There’s nothing in this world that compares to them. There’s no symbol, no image, no kind of light, no greatness, no example—nothing that could help me express what they are like.

Even the highest righteous beings in all the spiritual realms can’t compare to those in the highest regions. Their glory and greatness are so vast and immeasurable that it’s simply beyond anything I can describe to you here on Earth.”

When Jesus had finished speaking, Mary Magdalene came forward again and said:

“My Lord, please don’t be angry with me for asking so many questions. I only do so because I want everything to be explained clearly and precisely. My brothers and I are spreading your message to humanity, so that people may hear it, repent, and be saved from the harsh judgment of the evil rulers. We want them to rise to the Heights and inherit the Kingdom of Light.

We don’t just care about ourselves—we feel compassion for the whole human race. That’s why we ask so many questions—so we can share the truth clearly and help people escape from the darkness and the control of the violent beings who trap souls in the outermost regions.”

When Jesus heard Mary’s words, he was deeply moved with compassion. He replied:

“Ask anything you want, Mary. I will explain it to you clearly and precisely, without parables or comparisons.”

## What it means

This chapter reveals the immense scale and mystery of the spiritual realms. Jesus speaks of *Helpers*—powerful spiritual beings who protect and guard the Light—and shows how the glory of the higher realms makes even the most sacred places we know seem small in comparison.

At the same time, Mary Magdalene continues to model what it means to be a spiritual seeker: she asks persistent questions not for personal gain, but out of deep compassion for others. She and the other disciples are messengers, trying to bring truth and freedom to humanity.

Jesus honors this compassion. He responds not with annoyance but with tenderness, promising to reveal deeper knowledge. The message is clear: the desire to understand and to help others awaken is sacred.

## Reflection

* How does Mary’s compassion for humanity speak to your own spiritual calling or sense of responsibility?
* What does it mean that some aspects of the spiritual world are “beyond description”? How do you respond to mystery?
* How can you balance seeking truth for yourself while also serving others with that truth?
