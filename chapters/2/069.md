## Chapter 69 — Thomas Interprets Sophia's Song

When the First Mystery had finished speaking to his disciples, Thomas stepped forward and said, “My Lord, the Light within me has heard, and my mind has understood your words. Please allow me to explain the meaning of the song.”

The First Mystery replied, “I give you permission to reveal the meaning of the song that Pistis Sophia sang to me.”

Thomas said, “My Lord, the song of Sophia, sung after she was saved from chaos, was foretold by your Light through Solomon, son of David, in his *Odes*:

1. I have been freed from my bonds and I run to you, Lord.

2. You stood by me, saving and helping me.

3. You blocked my enemies, hiding them from me, because your presence was with me, saving me by your grace.

4. I was rejected and scorned by many. I became as heavy as lead in their eyes.

5. But through you I received strength. You placed lights on my left and right, so I was surrounded by Light.

6. Your grace covered me like a shadow, and I was freed from my earthly coverings.

7. Your right hand lifted me up and removed my illness.

8. I am strong in your truth and purified by your righteousness.

9. My enemies have left me, and I am made right by your goodness. Your peace is everlasting.

This, my Lord, is the meaning behind Sophia’s prayer of deliverance.

Let me now explain each part:

When your Light said through Solomon: *‘I am saved from the bonds and run to you, O Lord’*—this is what Sophia meant when she said: *‘I am freed from the chains of darkness and have come to you, O Light.’*

When your Light said: *‘You were at my right hand, saving and helping me,’*—this matches Sophia’s words: *‘You were Light all around me, saving and helping me.’*

When Solomon wrote: *‘You hindered my enemies and kept them hidden,’*—Sophia echoed this: *‘You stopped the Self-Willed forces with your Light, and they could not come near me.’*

Solomon said: *‘Your presence saved me in grace,’*—Sophia said: *‘Your Light was with me and saved me through your stream of Light.’*

Solomon: *‘I was despised and cast out’*—Sophia: *‘The Self-Willed ones took my power and cast me into the chaos without Light.’*

Solomon: *‘I became as lead’*—Sophia: *‘I became heavy matter when my Light was taken from me.’*

Solomon: *‘Through you I gained strength’*—Sophia: *‘A Light-power came through you and saved me.’*

Solomon: *‘You placed lamps on every side’*—Sophia: *‘Your Light shone on all sides, leaving no part of me in darkness.’*

Solomon: *‘You covered me with your grace’*—Sophia: *‘You covered me with the Light of your stream.’*

Solomon: *‘I was freed from coats of skin’*—Sophia: *‘You purified me of evil and lifted me in your Light.’*

Solomon: *‘Your right hand lifted me and took away my sickness’*—Sophia: *‘Your Light raised me up and removed the forces that oppressed me.’*

Solomon: *‘I became strong in truth and pure in righteousness’*—Sophia: *‘I became strong in your Light and was purified in it.’*

Solomon: *‘My enemies left me’*—Sophia: *‘The Self-Willed powers left me.’*

Solomon: *‘I am justified by your goodness, for your peace lasts forever’*—Sophia: *‘I am saved by your goodness, for you save all.’*

This, O Lord, is the full interpretation of Sophia’s prayer, spoken when she was saved from chaos and released from the chains of darkness.

### What it means

In this chapter, Thomas acts as the sacred interpreter. He listens with both his outer mind and his inner Light. His explanation draws a divine thread between Sophia's suffering and the ancient wisdom encoded in Solomon’s Odes. This poetic reflection shows us that Sophia’s story is not hers alone—it is a universal song of the soul’s journey through darkness and its eventual redemption by the Light.

Each verse from Solomon is mirrored in Sophia’s own words. This symmetry reminds us that truth speaks across time and through many voices. Sophia’s cry is every soul’s cry when caught in despair. And her redemption reflects the timeless promise: the Light is always near.

Symbolically, the chaos is the unconscious depths of our psyche, where shame, fear, and confusion dwell. The Self-Willed forces are our inner tyrants—addictions, harmful beliefs, and egoic patterns—that strip us of our inner power. But the Light, the Divine Presence within, stands ready to cover, cleanse, and raise us up. The “coats of skin” represent our identification with the material, our false selves, which fall away when we return to the truth of who we are.

Thomas teaches us to recognize the hidden meaning behind every sacred word—and to know that every act of redemption echoes through eternity.

### Reflection

* What ancient or familiar truths are being reborn in your life in a new way today?
* Who or what are the “Self-Willed” forces within you that keep you from trusting the Light?
* How might your story—your struggles and healing—be part of a greater, eternal song?
