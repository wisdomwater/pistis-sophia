## Chapter 101 – The Limbs of the Ineffable

Jesus continued teaching his disciples, saying:

"Those who are worthy of the highest Mysteries—those that remain hidden in the Ineffable and have never gone forth—exist before even the First Mystery. To help you understand, I will speak in symbols.

Imagine the Ineffable as a divine body, and these Mysteries are like its limbs: the head exists according to the glory of the head, the eye according to the glory of the eye, the ear according to the ear, and so on. Many limbs, but one unified body.

Understand, I’m only using images to help you grasp what cannot truly be spoken. I have not revealed this in full truth—only a glimpse into the Mystery of the Ineffable.

I, the Saviour, am the treasury of all these Mysteries—the one in whom they are all stored. There is no other treasury like me, no equal in all the world. Yet, there are still more words, more Mysteries, more regions to be revealed.

Now listen carefully:

- Blessed is the one who finds the words of the Mysteries of the first space, which is outside the body.
- One who finds the Mysteries of the second space, which is within the body, is like a god.
- One who finds the Mysteries of the third space, the innermost region, is like a Saviour, beyond containment, greater than the universe, and like those who dwell in that sacred space.

Why? Because they have uncovered the Mystery that upholds those regions—and in doing so, become like those who dwell there.

And as for the one who discovers the Mysteries I’ve described today—the ones that are like the Limbs of the Ineffable—truly, I tell you, that person becomes the first in Truth. They become like the Ineffable itself.

Because these are not just teachings—they are the *Gnosis of the Gnosis* of the Ineffable. This is the depth of Mystery I have shared with you today."

### What it means

This chapter is the culmination of a sacred ascent. Jesus speaks of the ultimate Mysteries—those that have never left the heart of the Divine, known only through symbols and indirect teaching. These are the Mysteries of the Ineffable, the Source beyond all names and forms.

By using the metaphor of a body, Jesus is pointing to the interconnectedness of all levels of being—head, eye, ear, heart—as symbolic representations of different glories within the Divine. While there are many “limbs,” there is still one unified Essence.

The three "spaces" refer to progressively deeper spiritual realities. As a person advances through these inner realms:
- They move from outer understanding (blessedness),
- To inner awakening (godlike perception),
- To divine union (becoming like the Saviour, beyond the universe itself).

To find the deepest Mystery is to discover the origin of everything—what sustains all things. This is called here the *gnosis of gnosis*—not just knowing, but knowing the Source of knowing.

This isn’t about intellect. It’s about spiritual transformation: *becoming* like the First through alignment with the Mystery.

### Reflection

* What “space” are you dwelling in today—outer, inner, or innermost?
* What does it mean to you that the Divine can only be described in symbols?
* What Mystery are you being invited to dwell in, to embody, even if it cannot be fully explained?
