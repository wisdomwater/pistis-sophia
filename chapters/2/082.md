# Chapter 82 — Philip Interprets Sophia's Song

After Jesus had finished speaking, Philip stepped forward and said:

“Jesus, my Lord, my understanding has been lifted, and I have grasped the meaning behind the song Pistis Sophia sang. The prophet David spoke of this long ago in Psalm 106, when he said:

1. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his mercy endures forever.

2. Let those whom the Lord has redeemed declare it—he has rescued them from the hands of their enemies.

3. He has gathered them from the east and west, from the north and from the sea.

4. They wandered in a desert, parched and without water, unable to find the way home.

5. Hungry and thirsty, their spirit was weak.

6. But they cried out to the Lord in their suffering, and he rescued them from their distress.

7. He led them on a straight path, back to their true home.

8. Let them thank the Lord for his kindness and the wonders he does for humanity.

9. He satisfies the hungry soul and fills it with good things.

10. To those sitting in darkness and death’s shadow, imprisoned in misery and iron chains—

11. For they had rebelled against God’s word and rejected the will of the Most High—

12. Their hearts were humbled in suffering; they were weak and had no one to help.

13. But they cried out to the Lord, and he delivered them.

14. He led them out of darkness and broke their chains.

15. Let them thank the Lord for his kindness and his miracles for humanity.

16. He shattered bronze gates and broke iron bars.

17. He saved them from the path of sin that had brought them low.

18. They had lost all appetite and hovered near death.

19. But they cried out to the Lord, and he rescued them.

20. He sent his word, healed them, and freed them from their suffering.

21. Let them thank the Lord for his kindness and his miracles for all people.”

Philip concluded, saying, “This Psalm is the true interpretation of the song that Pistis Sophia sang in the presence of the twenty-four invisibles. She wanted them to understand the miracles you performed for her—and that you, Lord, have given your divine mysteries to humanity.”

When Jesus heard Philip’s words, he said:

“Well said, blessed Philip. That is indeed the meaning of Pistis Sophia’s song.”

## What it means

Chapter 82 closes the story of Pistis Sophia by affirming her journey through the lens of sacred scripture. Philip links Sophia’s song with Psalm 106—a hymn of redemption, exile, and restoration that mirrors her entire experience. It’s a poetic way of saying: *This is not a new story. This is the story of every soul that has ever wandered far from the Light and been brought home again.*

Sophia’s journey is validated by the ancient tradition of the Psalms. By quoting Psalm 106, Philip shows that her descent into chaos, her cries for help, and her ultimate rescue all follow a deeply rooted spiritual pattern. Humanity has always struggled, strayed, and suffered—and the Divine has always responded with compassion and deliverance.

This chapter also serves as a kind of benediction. The disciples, particularly Philip, recognize the significance of what has occurred: that Sophia’s return is not just about one being’s salvation—it’s about *all of us*. Her redemption is a promise that the same Light that saved her is available to every soul who seeks it.

The story ends not with punishment or judgment, but with gratitude and restoration. The Light has given its mysteries to humanity. The gates of darkness are shattered. The soul is free.

## Reflection

* Have you ever felt like the ancient stories of scripture were echoing your own experience?
* What patterns of exile and return have you lived through?
* How might you now, like Philip, speak truth and encouragement to others by affirming their journey back to wholeness?
