# Chapter 92 — The Mystery That Knows All Things

After Jesus finished speaking, the disciples were filled with joy. They were amazed and delighted to hear such deep teachings.

Then Jesus continued:

“Listen further, my beloved disciples, as I now speak to you about the full knowledge—the gnosis—of the great mystery of the Ineffable, the unknowable Source.

This supreme mystery holds the truth about all things—why they came to be, and why they will pass away:

* It knows why cruelty and compassion came into being.
* It knows why destruction arose, and why eternal life also came forth.
* It knows why reptiles and wild animals appeared—and why they will one day disappear.
* It knows why domesticated animals and birds were created.
* It knows why mountains and precious stones exist.
* It knows why gold, silver, copper, iron, stone, and lead came to be.
* It knows the origins of glass, wax, and all kinds of materials.
* It knows why plants and vegetables grew on the earth.
* It knows why the waters of the earth, and all life within them, were made.
* It knows why the very earth itself came into existence.
* It knows why seas and ocean creatures appeared.
* And finally, this mystery knows why the material world arose—and why it will ultimately be destroyed.

## What it means

This chapter continues the theme from Chapter 91: that the highest divine mystery—the “mystery of the Ineffable”—contains complete understanding of the origin and purpose of everything, from the most spiritual realities to the most mundane physical matter.

It is not just human behavior or moral dynamics that the mystery understands, but all of creation: animals, minerals, plants, even substances like glass and wax. The inclusion of such detail shows that nothing is random or meaningless. Everything—light or dark, animate or inanimate—emerged for a reason, and will one day dissolve into the same greater purpose.

Importantly, this mystery is not only knowledge about things. It reflects a state of divine consciousness—a way of *being* that sees through the veil of appearances and understands the unity and destiny of all things.

## Reflection

* This mystery is said to know not just people’s choices but why all things—animals, minerals, even destruction—exist. What does this say about the relationship between Spirit and the material world?
* How do you respond to the idea that the world and everything in it will eventually be destroyed? Does that evoke fear, peace, or something else?
* The chapter implies that there is *purpose* behind even destructive or unpleasant things. Can you think of a time when something difficult or broken eventually revealed its place in a larger picture?
