## Chapter 85 — Will Humans Surpass the Beings of Light?

After Jesus finished speaking of the vast realms of glory, Mary Magdalene stepped forward.

She said:

“My Lord, please don’t be angry with me for asking again. We only ask because we want to understand with complete clarity.”

Jesus replied warmly:

“Ask anything you wish, Mary. I will reveal it all to you plainly, with no riddles or metaphors. Whatever you ask, I will answer with precision and certainty.

I will complete you in every power and every fullness—from the innermost mysteries to the outermost limits, from the Ineffable Source to the darkness of darknesses. You will be called ‘the ones made perfect in all gnosis (divine knowledge).’

So ask freely, and I will answer you with joy.”

Mary, now filled with joy and awe, asked:

“Lord, will humans—those in the world who have received the mysteries of the Light—be greater than the emanations of the Treasury of the Light in your Kingdom?

For you said earlier: *If you lead us into the region of those who’ve received the mysteries, even the Light-land will seem like a speck of dust because of the vast glory of that higher region.*

Since the Light-land (the Treasury) is where the emanations dwell—are you saying that the humans who receive the mysteries will actually surpass them in your Kingdom?”

### What it means

This chapter begins a profound and daring question from Mary. She’s thinking carefully and making connections. Based on what Jesus said earlier—how each higher realm eclipses the one before—she realizes something startling:

If those who’ve received the mysteries of the Light are above even the emanations of the Treasury… does that mean human beings, transformed by spiritual initiation, can ascend higher than even the exalted cosmic beings of Light?

And Mary isn’t just asking out of curiosity—she’s rejoicing. The idea that human souls could ascend to such divine heights brings her deep joy.

Jesus doesn’t answer yet—that comes in the next chapter—but his openness and promise are already striking. He says plainly that he will perfect his followers with knowledge and fullness, guiding them from the Ineffable Source all the way to the depths.

This moment marks an important transition:
It isn’t just about heavenly realms or beings—it’s about the destiny of the soul. Mary is asking: *Is it possible that a fully awakened human could surpass even the luminous beings of the heavens?*

### Reflection

* What do you think Mary’s question reveals about the potential of the human soul?
* How does Jesus’ promise to reveal “all with joy” shift your view of divine teaching and spiritual authority?
* Does it challenge your view of your own worth to consider that a soul awakened in this world could surpass even angelic beings?
