## Chapter 98 — The Mysteries Within Mysteries

After Jesus finished speaking to his disciples, Mary Magdalene stepped forward, knelt, and kissed his feet. She said, “My Lord, please be patient with me. Don’t be angry if I keep asking questions. Have mercy on us, and help us understand everything. Tell us, how can the First Mystery have twelve mysteries, and how can the Ineffable have only one mystery?”

Jesus replied, “The Ineffable indeed has only one great mystery. But that one mystery can be understood in different ways—it reveals itself as three mysteries, and also as five mysteries. Though it’s still one, each part has its own form. These five mysteries share the same essential light, but each has a different type or function. They are greater than the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, yet still not equal to the First Mystery itself in the kingdom of Light.

“In the same way, the three mysteries are each unique. Their forms are not the same, and none of them are identical with the one great mystery of the First Mystery.

**The First Mystery**

“If someone completes the first mystery with full devotion—performing all its symbolic acts—they will immediately leave their body and become a stream of great Light. Their soul will pass unharmed through all regions ruled by darkness and reach the kingdom of its mystery. All the powers will be afraid of the soul because of the Light it carries.

**The Second Mystery**

“If someone completes the second mystery and speaks it over the head and into the ears of a person who is dying—and if that dying person has already received the truth once before—then their soul will also become a stream of Light and ascend safely to the kingdom of that mystery.

“But even if the dying person hasn’t received any mysteries or truth, the power of the second mystery will still protect them. They won’t be judged or punished. Fire won’t touch them. Instead, they will be passed along through various realms until they are brought before the Virgin of Light. All these regions will fear the mark of the Ineffable that is upon the soul.

“When the Virgin of Light sees the sign of that mystery, she will be amazed. She will test the soul but won’t let it return to the Light until it has lived a new life—a life of purity and renunciation of worldly attachments. Then she will seal the soul with a higher mark and place it into a righteous body that can seek divine truth and receive greater mysteries. This is the gift of the second mystery.

**The Third Mystery**

“If someone completes the third mystery and speaks it over a soul who has died—even if that soul is trapped in the fires and punishments of the lower rulers—the soul will be rescued. The mystery’s power will bring the soul quickly to the Virgin of Light. She will seal it with a higher mark and send it into a new, righteous body that can find the divine truth and inherit the Light. This is the gift of the third mystery.

**The Higher Mysteries**

“All who receive one of the five mysteries of the Ineffable will inherit the kingdom of that mystery when they leave the body. These five are more exalted than the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, yet they are still below the three highest mysteries.

Those who receive one of the three mysteries will inherit an even greater kingdom. But even these three are not equal to the one and only highest mystery of the Ineffable.

There are also mysteries tied to the different levels of divine reality. Those who receive the mystery of the entire universe of the Ineffable, or other hidden mysteries in its divine limbs and structures, will inherit to the level of the mystery they have received. These mysteries are beyond symbols, beyond words, beyond signs. They pass through all lower regions without being stopped or questioned.

Only in the outermost region—called the third space—are there tokens and signs needed for passage. I will explain all this when I speak of how the universe is expanded and structured.

**The Thousand-Year Reign**

And finally, when all perfect souls have awakened and received their mysteries—when the mystery that sustains the universe is fulfilled—I will reign for a thousand years in the Light. I will be king over all Light and all the perfected souls who have received their mysteries.”

### What it means

This chapter unveils the layered depth of spiritual truth, showing how one Divine Mystery contains many facets—like a single Light refracting through different prisms. The “First Mystery” and the “Ineffable” represent the highest states of divine consciousness. Within them are nested mysteries, each reflecting different aspects of divine reality and spiritual awakening.

Each mystery, when completed with sincerity, allows the soul to transcend suffering, judgment, and the prison of material existence. Symbolically, the “figures” of each mystery represent spiritual disciplines, inner transformations, and sacred knowledge. When the soul fully embodies these truths, it becomes a being of Light, no longer bound by fear, punishment, or death.

The Virgin of Light represents the divine intelligence that tests and redeems the soul. She helps the soul incarnate again—not as a punishment, but as an opportunity to find the Divine in truth and inherit eternal Light.

The idea of mysteries helping both the initiated and uninitiated reveals something profound: Divine mercy extends beyond knowledge and ritual. Even those who are lost can be redeemed through the compassion of those who have embraced the mysteries.

At the highest level, this text suggests that each of us is called to receive deeper layers of spiritual truth. As we do, we are transformed—not just intellectually, but existentially. We move closer to our divine origin. And when the full number of souls have awakened, divine harmony will reign in all realms.

### Reflection

* What “mysteries” or spiritual truths have you begun to live—not just understand, but embody?
* Where in your life are you still clinging to the material world instead of trusting the Light to carry you?
* How might your inner transformation help others—both the awakened and the lost—find their way to healing and freedom?
