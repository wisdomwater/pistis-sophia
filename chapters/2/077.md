## Chapter 77 - Sophia’s Appeal to Divine Justice

While I was with you on the Mount of Olives, and the time had come, Adamas looked down from the twelve aeons into the chaos. He saw his dark power there, now empty of all light because I had taken its light away. Seeing it in complete darkness and unable to return to its own region—the twelve moons—Adamas became furious.

He wrongly believed that Pistis Sophia was responsible for imprisoning his power and stealing its light. Enraged, he created two dark and violent emanations from himself to attack her. He also made a dark region in his realm to trap her. He sent many of his rulers to pursue her, hoping these two emanations would drag her into this new dark chaos and strip her of all her remaining light. His plan was to give her light to the two emanations so they could carry it into the lower chaos, hoping to restore his power there.

As these forces chased her, Sophia remembered my promise: if she was ever attacked and called to me in song, I would come quickly to help her. So, while I sat with you on the Mount of Olives, she cried out once more to the Light and sang:

**Sophia’s Song of Deliverance**

1. O Light of lights, I have trusted you. Save me from these rulers who pursue me.

2. Don’t let them take my light like the lion-faced power once tried. I have no light of my own—only yours could save me. But Adamas is furious, blaming me for trapping his power.

3. O Light, if I truly did trap it, if I have done anything wrong...

4. ...then let these rulers take my light and leave me empty.

5. Let Adamas take my light, throw it into the chaos, and trap me there forever.

6. But if I am innocent, rise in your power and defend me against those who oppress me.

7. Come quickly and give me life, just as you promised.

### What It Means

This chapter shows the intensifying struggle between Sophia and the dark powers. Adamas, acting from pride and blame, lashes out at her, still misunderstanding her true nature. Rather than taking vengeance into her own hands, Sophia appeals again to the Light—not just for rescue, but for justice.

Her song is a bold prayer. She says: *If I am guilty, let me suffer. But if I am innocent, then rescue me.* This is the language of radical integrity and deep surrender. She trusts that the Light sees all, knows all, and will act in truth.

Sophia’s growth is visible here. She’s no longer lost in despair. Though still under attack, she has gained the strength to ask for help and face divine judgment without fear. Her relationship with the Light has become one of deeper trust.

* Can you relate to Sophia's willingness to face the consequences if she’s wrong—and to trust in divine justice if she’s not?
* What does this chapter reveal about how the Light responds to sincere cries for help?
