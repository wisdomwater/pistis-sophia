## Chapter 66 — The Triumph of Trust in the Light

Before I was allowed to rescue Pistis Sophia from the chaos—because the time had not yet come by order of the First Mystery who sees within—something else happened.

When the forces of Self-Willed realized I had taken the light-powers they had stolen from Pistis Sophia and restored them to her, and when they saw that she was glowing again with her original brilliance, they were furious. They cried out to Self-Willed to help them once more so they could steal the light from her again.

So Self-Willed, from his domain in the thirteenth realm, sent a more powerful and aggressive energy down into the chaos—like an arrow shot from above. When it arrived, the forces that had been tormenting Pistis Sophia were encouraged and became even more aggressive. One turned into a massive serpent. Another became a seven-headed basilisk. Another, a fearsome dragon. The lion-faced power and all the many other forces of Self-Willed surrounded her, driving her deeper into chaos and terrifying her again.

Then another figure appeared—Adamas the Tyrant, from the twelve realms. He too was angry at Pistis Sophia because she dared to seek the Light that was above them all. Seeing her being attacked, he joined in and threw his own violent energy into the chaos. This force struck her down, and she was once again overwhelmed by all these monstrous, terrifying beings—serpent, basilisk, lion, dragon, and more—all trying to steal her light and break her spirit.

Terrified and worn down, Pistis Sophia cried out once more to the Light:

1. O Light, you are the one who has helped me—let your light shine on me again.
2. You are my protector, and I come to you in faith.
3. You will save me from the forces of Self-Willed and Adamas, the Tyrant, and from all their violent threats.

Hearing her cry, and with permission from my Father, the First Mystery who sees within, I sent Gabriel, Michael, and the great light-stream to help her. I told them to carry her so she wouldn’t sink further into darkness, and to guide her safely through the chaos.

When they arrived with the blazing light-stream, all the attacking forces were stunned by its brilliance. They fled from her. The light wrapped around Pistis Sophia like a glowing shield, a wreath of radiant protection around her head.

Encouraged by this, she found her strength again. No longer afraid of the forces of chaos—not even the new violent energy sent like an arrow, or the wrath of Adamas—she stood firm within the light. It didn’t leave her; it surrounded her completely.

By my command, the light-stream grew even brighter around her. She stood within this radiant brilliance, with light to her left, her right, and all around her, like a crown of glory. The dark forces couldn’t bear the sight of it. Many fell at her feet, overwhelmed by the brightness. They couldn’t approach her or harm her anymore because she had placed her trust in the Light.

Then, as commanded by the First Mystery, I myself entered the chaos, shining with immeasurable light. I went to the lion-faced power and drained all of its energy. I then subdued all the forces of Self-Willed so they could no longer return to their realm in the thirteenth æon. I stripped them of their powers, and they fell helpless in the chaos.

I brought Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, with Gabriel on one side and Michael on the other. The light-stream flowed back into her once again. She looked upon her enemies and saw that their power was gone.

I led her out of the chaos. She stepped on the serpent-faced force of Self-Willed, on the seven-headed basilisk, on the lion and the dragon. I had her stand triumphantly on the most fearsome of them all—the seven-headed basilisk, the embodiment of their evil. And I, the First Mystery, took all its power and destroyed its essence so that it would never rise again.

### What it means

This chapter paints a powerful inner journey—a soul, represented by Pistis Sophia, descends into darkness and chaos after seeking divine Light beyond the false systems of control. The “emanations of Self-Willed” symbolize the many inner and outer forces that resist transformation—fear, pride, self-sabotage, trauma, shame, and the illusions of ego.

Sophia’s attackers take on terrifying forms—serpents, basilisks, dragons—not just to frighten, but to reflect the distorted energies within us that rear up when we begin to awaken. The lion-faced force represents pride and domination, while Adamas the Tyrant is the inner critic, the voice of condemnation that hates our longing to ascend beyond the old ways.

But Sophia does not fight them with might—she cries out to the Light in faith. Her surrender becomes her salvation. This shows us that we are not meant to overcome the darkness alone, but to trust and call upon the Divine Light within and around us.

The Light’s response is not harsh or punishing. Instead, it sends loving help—Gabriel and Michael, the protectors and messengers, and the “light-stream,” a divine current of grace. The Light surrounds Sophia and becomes her crown, her defense, her strength.

Eventually, Christ—the First Mystery who "looks without"—enters the chaos directly. He doesn't just save Sophia but dismantles the power of her oppressors. He leads her out, glorified, triumphant, treading on the very forces that once tormented her.

This is a message of resurrection: the soul that trusts, endures, and calls out in faith will not only be saved, but will rise—crowned in light, walking over every defeated shadow.

### Reflection

* What inner voices or energies in your life resemble the serpent, the dragon, or the tyrant? How do they try to pull you away from your true Light?
* In moments of fear or despair, how do you cry out to the Divine? What helps you reconnect with trust?
* What might it look like for you to be surrounded by Light—to be crowned with it—and to walk out of chaos with strength and grace?
