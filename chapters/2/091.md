# Chapter 91 — The Levels of Light and the Mystery of All Things

Jesus responded to John’s question, saying:

“You’ve asked wisely and carefully, John. Now listen while I explain this clearly.

Anyone who has received a mystery of the Light will live in the spiritual region that corresponds to the level of mystery they have received. They do not have the ability to go higher into realms beyond their level.

For example:

* If someone has received only the first level of commandments, they can visit or influence realms below them, but cannot go upward to the higher realms.

* If someone receives the mysteries of the ‘First Mystery,’ which is part of the 24 outer mysteries, they can move through and understand all realms below them, but they cannot rise into higher realms.

* Those within the 24 outer mysteries can each reach their designated level and freely move below, but not above.

* Those who attain the First Mystery in the third space also can go down through all lower orders, but not rise above.

* If someone receives the mystery of the first Thrice-Spiritual—which rules over the 24 mysteries—they can move freely through everything below that level, but not above into the realms of the Ineffable (the highest Light).

* If someone attains the second Thrice-Spiritual, they can access everything within and below the first Thrice-Spiritual, but not the third.

* If someone reaches the third Thrice-Spiritual, they can move through everything below—including all three Thrice-Spirituals and the full First Mystery—but still cannot rise to the space of the Ineffable.

**The Master Mystery**

Now, if someone receives the Master Mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable—the full set of twelve highest mysteries—they gain a different kind of authority.

This person has the power to move freely through all levels and all realms:

* From within to without, from above to below, from depth to height, from length to breadth—every direction, every realm, every spiritual inheritance of the Light.

They are free to abide wherever they choose in the Light-kingdom.

And truly, I tell you:
At the end of the world, this person will be crowned as king over all orders of the Light’s inheritance.

**The Gnosis of the Master**

Whoever receives this supreme mystery will understand the deepest reasons behind everything—not just light, but also darkness.

This mystery knows:

* Why darkness and light came into being.
* Why chaos and the Treasury of the Light exist.
* Why judgment, punishment, and the places of rest were created.
* Why sin, evil, and salvation arose.
* Why suffering, redemption, death, life, and even human behaviors like pride, humility, laughter, tears, deceit, and purity all exist.

In short, this mystery holds the complete knowledge of all creation—both shadow and light.

## What it means

This chapter teaches the idea that spiritual growth happens through stages, each opening new awareness and ability. People cannot leap to the highest levels without first preparing their soul by receiving and embodying deeper mysteries.

But those who attain the Master Mystery become like sovereigns in the spiritual universe—able to travel freely, understand all things, and dwell where they choose. This mystery is not just knowledge, but a divine awakening that understands both why goodness exists and why evil has been permitted.

This is the kind of mystery that sees the whole picture—not from a place of judgment, but from compassionate divine understanding.

## Reflection

* What does it mean to you that some people receive greater “mysteries” and can move more freely in the spiritual realm?
* Do you resonate with the idea that we each inhabit a “level” based on our inner transformation rather than external achievements?
* The Master Mystery is about understanding both darkness and light. Have you had moments in your life where pain or darkness later led to deeper insight or compassion?
