## Chapter 63 — Grace, Truth, and the Mystery of Unity

John stepped forward and said, “Lord, please allow me to explain the meaning of the words your Light-Power once prophesied through David.”

Jesus replied, “Yes, John, I give you permission. Speak the meaning of the prophecy from David:

‘Grace and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed.
Truth springs up from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.’”

John answered, “These words reflect what you told us before: ‘I came from the Heights and entered into Sabaoth the Good, and I embraced the Light-Power in him.’ You, Lord, are the ‘grace’—sent from the highest realms by the First Mystery, who sees inwardly. You came to offer mercy to the whole world. ‘Truth’ is the power of Sabaoth the Good, which united with you. You, as the First Mystery looking outward, cast that truth toward the Left, and Sabaoth the Good took it and placed it into the matter of Barbēlō. He declared the Truth to all in the regions of the Left. That matter—Barbēlō—is the body you now wear.

‘Righteousness and peace kissed each other’: You are ‘righteousness,’ bringing all the sacred mysteries from your Father, the First Mystery who sees inwardly. You baptized the power of Sabaoth the Good, then went to the rulers and gave them the mysteries of the Heights, transforming them into beings of righteousness and goodness.

‘Peace’ is the power of Sabaoth—it is your soul—which entered the matter of Barbēlō. The rulers of the six realms of Yabraoth have now made peace with the Mystery of the Light.

And ‘truth springing up from the earth’ refers to the power of Sabaoth the Good. It came from the region of the Right, outside the Treasury of the Light, into the Left realms, entered the matter of Barbēlō, and announced the mysteries of the Truth to all there.

‘Righteousness looking down from heaven’ is you, the First Mystery who sees outwardly. You descended from the High Realms with the mysteries of the Light-Kingdom and came down upon your light-vesture, which Barbēlō gave you. That vesture is Jesus, our Savior, and you descended like a dove upon him.”

When John finished speaking, the First Mystery who looks outward said to him, “Well said, John, my beloved brother.”

### What it means

This chapter is a beautiful, symbolic weaving of divine principles into a single act of spiritual unity. The figures—Grace, Truth, Righteousness, and Peace—are not just cosmic entities, but qualities within the human soul. The meeting of grace and truth, and the kiss of righteousness and peace, represent the harmonization of divine love and reality within us.

"Grace" symbolizes divine compassion—Jesus as the gift from above, offering us a path back to Light regardless of our past. "Truth" is the spark of clarity and authenticity within us, often buried beneath layers of illusion but always striving to emerge. Together, they reconcile—the heart and the mind, the giver and the seeker.

"Righteousness" represents divine order and right action, and "peace" the deep stillness and harmony of the soul when it returns to its divine nature. When these two "kiss," it reflects a moment of deep integration—the inner knowing that we are aligned with something higher, and that nothing in us is divided anymore.

Barbēlō, as the source of divine matter, is the cosmic womb—the body and world into which divine truth must descend. The soul’s descent into this realm is not a fall, but a mission. It is within the earth, the body, and the suffering of existence that Truth "sprouts"—a sign that even in our brokenness, something holy takes root.

This chapter calls us to recognize that the Light is not only above us but also within us, clothed in our very being. Jesus descending “like a dove” upon the light-vesture is an image of divine presence inhabiting our humanity, not to reject it, but to redeem and glorify it.

### Reflection

* Where in your life have grace and truth begun to meet—where compassion and honesty have come together?
* What does it mean for you personally to “wear the light-vesture” in your daily life?
* How might righteousness and peace kiss within your own heart—what inner opposites need reconciling?
