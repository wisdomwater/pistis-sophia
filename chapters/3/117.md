## Chapter 117 — The Greater Mysteries and Eternal Forgiveness

And again, I, Mary, spoke and said to the Lord,  
“My Lord, I still have more questions. Please be patient with me as I continue to ask. We now understand how the baptisms forgive sins. But I want to ask about the greater mysteries—the mysteries of the Three Spaces, the First Mystery, and even the mysteries of the Ineffable. How do these forgive sins? Do they work the same way as the baptisms, or is it different?”

And the Saviour answered and said to me:  
“No, Mary, they do not work in the same way as the baptisms. All the mysteries of the Three Spaces forgive the soul of all the sins it has committed in any of the realms governed by the rulers—from the very beginning until now. And they also forgive the sins it will commit in the future, up to the time each mystery remains active. I will tell you later when each mystery stops being effective—when the expansion of the universe is complete.

But the mystery of the First Mystery—and beyond that, the mysteries of the Ineffable—these are even greater. They forgive the soul of all its sins and iniquities in every realm of the rulers. And not only do they completely forgive everything the soul has ever done—but from that moment forward, they count no sin against it at all, for all eternity. This happens because of the sheer magnitude and glory of that ultimate mystery.”

### What it means

Mary continues to ask thoughtful, probing questions about the nature of spiritual purification—and Jesus honors her with deeper truths.

Here, Jesus reveals a profound hierarchy of forgiveness. Baptism clears away the past, healing what has already been done. But the greater mysteries—the ones of the Three Spaces, the First Mystery, and especially the Ineffable—operate on a completely higher level. These don't just cleanse the soul of past wrongs; they rewrite the soul's standing entirely. For those who receive these mysteries, sins are no longer even counted. The soul becomes aligned with something so divine, so full of Light, that judgment no longer applies.

This is not about earning forgiveness but receiving transformation. The soul becomes radiant with the grace of a mystery so glorious that even future sins cannot stain it.

### Reflection

* Do you believe it's possible for the soul to reach a state beyond judgment?
* What might it feel like to live from a place where nothing is counted against you?
* How does this idea of total, eternal forgiveness change how you view your spiritual path?
