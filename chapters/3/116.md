## Chapter 116 — Fire, Baptism, and Inner Division

And Jesus, the Saviour, asked us, “Do you understand the way I am speaking with you?”

I, Mary, stepped forward once more and said,
“Yes, my Lord. I truly do listen closely to all your words. Regarding your teaching on the forgiveness of sins, you once spoke to us in a parable, saying: ‘I have come to cast fire on the earth—and what do I desire, but that it be kindled?’ And again you said: ‘I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!’ And still again you said: ‘Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, but division. For from now on, five will be in one house, three divided against two, and two against three.’ My Lord, this is what you said clearly.”

And I offered this interpretation:
“When you said, ‘I have come to cast fire on the earth,’ you meant the mysteries of the baptisms that you have brought into the world. Your desire is that this sacred fire will consume the sins of souls and purify them.

“And when you said, ‘I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed,’ you meant that you will not remain in the world until these baptisms have been fulfilled and the souls of the perfected ones made clean.

“And the saying, ‘I have not come to bring peace, but division... three against two, and two against three,’ this too refers to the mystery of the baptisms. They cause a division within the human being, separating the body, the counterfeiting spirit, and destiny into one portion—and the soul and its power into another. That is the meaning of ‘three against two, and two against three.’”

And when I finished speaking, the Saviour said,
“Well said, O spiritual and light-pure Mary. This is indeed the true interpretation.”

### What it means

Mary again reveals her profound spiritual insight. She understands that the teachings of Jesus about fire, baptism, and division are not about external conflict, but about an inner spiritual transformation. The “fire” is the divine baptism—a sacred mystery that burns away sin. It is not meant to bring worldly peace, but to initiate a necessary inner division: a separation between the soul and the forces that entangle it in material existence (like the body, the counterfeiting spirit, and destiny).

This chapter teaches that true purification is not comfortable. It brings division within—the old self resisting the new, the false being pulled away from the true. It is through this inner division that the soul is freed and made whole.

### Reflection

* What “inner divisions” have you experienced when seeking spiritual transformation?
* How does the image of divine fire resonate with your experience of healing or letting go?
* Can you sense parts of yourself—like old habits, fears, or identities—that are being separated out so that your soul might grow more free?
