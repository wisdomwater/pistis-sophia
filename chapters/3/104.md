# Chapter 104 — Seventy Times Seven: The Power of Ongoing Forgiveness

After Jesus finished speaking, John stepped forward and asked:

“Master, what if a man has lived in sin and broken all the laws—he’s full of wrongdoing—but then he repents for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven? Suppose he renounces the world and everything in it, and we give him the first mysteries of the Light that exist in the outermost realm. If he receives them, but then later falls back into sin again—and then repents once more and turns his back on the world again with deep sincerity, and we see he truly longs for God—should we then give him the second mystery of the outer realm?

And what if he falls back again into sin, then once more turns back, repents deeply, and again renounces the world—not as a hypocrite but truly—and we decide to give him the first mysteries again?

Suppose he sins again, in every kind of way. Should we forgive him up to *seven times* and continue to give him the mysteries of the outer realm each time?”

Jesus answered:

“Not just seven times, but many times seven.

Every time he turns back with true repentance, forgive him and give him the mysteries again—starting from the beginning. Perhaps you will save the soul of your brother, and he will eventually inherit the Kingdom of Light.

This is why, when you asked me before, ‘If our brother sins against us, should we forgive him up to seven times?’ I answered you with a parable: ‘Not just seven, but *seventy times seven*.’

So forgive him many times, and each time give him the mysteries of the outer realm. There is always a chance that you will win his soul and bring him to the Light.

And know this truth:

Whoever keeps another soul alive in the spiritual path—whoever helps even *one* soul be saved—not only will he have his own dignity in the Kingdom of Light, but he will receive extra dignity for the soul he saved. And the more souls he saves, the more glory and honor he will receive in the Kingdom.”

## What it means

This chapter is about radical grace and the spiritual value of patient love. John wants to know how many times they should forgive someone who keeps failing and repenting—over and over again.

Jesus’ response is stunning in its compassion: *“As many times as it takes.”*

Even if a person backslides again and again, as long as they come back with true longing and repentance, they should be forgiven, and the spiritual teachings should be given to them again.

This isn’t indulgence—it’s commitment to a soul’s potential. Jesus is clear: saving a soul isn’t just an act of kindness, it’s a sacred service. Helping even *one* soul brings great honor in the Kingdom of Light. Helping *many* multiplies that spiritual glory.

This chapter invites us to be generous, patient, and tireless in helping others walk the spiritual path—no matter how many times they stumble.

## Reflection

* Have you ever judged someone (or yourself) for “failing” too many times on the spiritual path?
* What does this chapter teach you about forgiveness—not just for others, but for yourself?
* Is there someone in your life right now who needs to hear that it’s not too late to begin again?
