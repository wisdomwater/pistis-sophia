## Chapter 110 — The Mystery That Transforms the Body and Heals the World

After Jesus had spoken, Mary once again knelt before him, kissed his feet, and said:

“My Lord, I still have questions. Please reveal your truth to us—don’t keep anything hidden.”

Jesus replied:

“Ask whatever you wish, and I will reveal it to you openly, without symbols or parables.”

Mary asked:

“Lord, didn’t you bring these divine mysteries into the world to deal with the conditions of life—like poverty and wealth, weakness and strength, illness and health? I mean, when we travel to different places, and the people there don’t believe in us or listen to our words, if we perform the mysteries, won’t they know then that we speak with the authority of the true God of the universe?”

Jesus said to her, in front of the other disciples:

“Yes, Mary. I’ve explained this to you before, but I will say it again so it’s clear.

Any person—not just you—who completes the mystery of raising the dead—the same mystery that heals sickness, casts out demons, and restores sight to the blind, strength to the lame, voice to the mute, and hearing to the deaf—whoever completes that mystery and truly lives it...

That person will be able to ask for anything: abundance in place of poverty, strength in place of weakness, healing of the body, restoration of life itself—and it will be given. Everything I just listed will quickly come to pass for the one who lives that mystery.”

At this, the disciples were overwhelmed. They rushed forward and cried out together:

“Savior, your words have filled us with such longing! Our souls are stirred to the point of madness. They yearn to leave our bodies and return to you, for we come from you. The power of these mysteries fills us with such intensity, we feel ready to ascend now to your kingdom.”

### What it means

Mary’s question cuts to the heart of a missionary's fear: What if they don’t believe us? She asks if the mysteries can serve as a witness, a kind of proof, especially in places where people reject their message.

Jesus' response affirms the power of the sacred mysteries to transform not just souls, but physical reality. He confirms that these mysteries are not only spiritual practices, but living forces that can heal illness, bring abundance, and even raise the dead. They serve as signs of divine authority—not as magic tricks, but as embodiments of Divine Light working through a person who is fully attuned to it.

And the disciples are shaken by this. They're not skeptical—they’re overwhelmed. They’re so moved by the possibility of living with that kind of power and connection to the Divine that their souls feel ready to leave their bodies, to return to the source they came from.

This is spiritual ecstasy—not in the emotional sense, but in the literal sense: *ekstasis* in Greek means “to stand outside oneself.” Their yearning is so intense that they feel ready to dissolve into the Light.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to you that spiritual mysteries can affect things like poverty, sickness, or even death?
* Have you ever had an experience—spiritual or otherwise—that left you feeling “beside yourself” with awe or longing?
* How does the disciples’ response reflect the tension between being *in the world* and longing to *return to the Light*?
