# Chapter 107 — When Mercy Meets Deceit: What Happens to Pretenders of the Light

After Jesus had spoken, John asked again:

“Lord, please allow me to keep asking. I want to understand these things clearly, so we can teach the truth to the people of the world.”

Jesus replied:

“Ask anything you want, John. I will tell you everything openly and clearly—without parables or riddles.”

John continued:

“Suppose we go into a town or village, and the people there welcome us warmly—but in reality, they are pretending. We don’t know their true hearts, so we stay in their homes, thinking they sincerely seek God. If they act humble and obedient, and we give them the mysteries of the Light, but later discover they were deceiving us, only pretending to be sincere so they could test us and expose the mysteries—what should we do then? What happens to such people?”

Jesus answered:

“When you go into a town and someone welcomes you into their home, you may give them a mystery. If they are truly worthy, you will win their soul and help them enter the Light-kingdom.

But if they are deceivers—if they only pretended to welcome you, and they exposed the mysteries without reverence or respect—then call upon the First Mystery of the First Mystery, which shows mercy to all. Say:

‘O Mystery, which we gave to these unworthy and deceitful souls who have misused your gift—return this mystery to us, and cast them out from the Light forever.’

And shake the dust from your feet as a sign against them, saying: ‘Let your souls be like the dust of this house.’

Truly, I tell you: in that very moment, every mystery you gave them will return to you. All the divine words and insights they received will be taken from them.

Then Jesus said:

“I told you this already in symbolic form: ‘When you enter a home, say “Peace be upon this house.” If they are worthy, let your peace rest on them. If not, let your peace return to you.’ That means: If they truly seek God, you may give them the mysteries. But if they deceive you and misuse the mysteries, then invoke the First Mystery, and everything will be undone—they will be strangers to the Light forever.

Such souls will not be reborn again into the world. Instead, they will dwell in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness.

And even if they one day try to repent, renouncing everything and seeking the Light in full submission, no mystery can forgive them—except the Mystery of the Ineffable, which alone has mercy for every soul and forgives all sins.”

## What it means

This chapter speaks to the seriousness of sacred knowledge—and the sacred trust of those who carry it. The disciples ask a very human question: *What if we’re fooled? What if someone acts sincere, but they’re only pretending to get access to divine secrets?*

Jesus’ response is both sobering and merciful.

He says, Yes, you may sometimes be deceived. But if your intention was pure, and theirs was false, you can reclaim what you gave by invoking the First Mystery—which acts like a divine retraction, severing their connection to the Light. The wisdom, energy, and spiritual gifts they received will dissolve, and they’ll no longer have access to the sacred teachings.

And yet, even for such people, one tiny door remains open: the Ineffable, the nameless Mystery of pure Divine Mercy. Even when all other pathways are shut, that highest Light may still forgive—if the soul truly turns back with full surrender.

This chapter is a strong warning: don’t play games with the Divine. But it’s also a message of hope—God’s mercy is deeper than any deception.

## Reflection

* Have you ever been deceived by someone who pretended to be on a spiritual path?
* How do you practice discernment between sincerity and performance—in others and in yourself?
* What do you think it means to “reclaim” what was given? Can sacred energy be withdrawn?
