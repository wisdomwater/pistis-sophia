# Chapter 105 — When to Let Go: Mercy, Boundaries, and the Power of the First Mystery

After Jesus had finished speaking, John stepped forward again and said:

“Master, please bear with me as I ask more questions, because now I want to understand exactly how we’re supposed to teach all this to the world.

Suppose I give a fellow brother one of the beginning-level mysteries from the outer realm, and I give him several of these mysteries—but he doesn’t live in a way that’s worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Should we still let him move on to the deeper mysteries of the next space, just in case he might turn, repent, and be saved? Or should we stop him there?”

Jesus answered:

“If he’s not pretending—if he truly longs for God—and if you’ve already given him the early mysteries many times, and he hasn’t lived up to them because of the forces of fate and not out of hypocrisy, then yes: forgive him. Let him move on and give him the first mystery of the second space. You might yet win his soul.

And if he stumbles again—falls into sin—and then turns back in real repentance, renounces the world again, and you’re sure he’s being sincere, then yes: forgive him again. Let him move forward and give him the second mystery of the second space of the First Mystery.

And if again he sins, but once more returns with true repentance, rejecting the world completely, and you truly know he’s not faking—then once again, forgive him. Give him the three mysteries together from the second space of the First Mystery.

But if after that, he again falls into sin and wrongdoing, from that point on, you are not to forgive him or accept his repentance. Let him be counted as someone who has rejected the path—a stumbling block and a transgressor.

For I tell you this truth: those three mysteries will serve as witnesses for his final opportunity to repent. From then on, his soul won’t return to the higher worlds. It will be sent to the outer darkness—the place of the dragon.

Jesus continued:

“This is what I meant before when I said: ‘If your brother sins against you, talk to him privately. If he listens, you’ve won him back. If not, take someone else with you. If he still won’t listen, bring it before the assembly. If he still refuses, treat him as an outsider.’

What that means spiritually is this: If someone fails to live according to the first mystery, give him the second. If he fails again, give him all three mysteries together—this is ‘the assembly.’ But if he still doesn’t change after that, he must be considered a stumbling block.

And Jesus concluded with this profound statement:

“When I said, ‘Every word must be confirmed by two or three witnesses,’ this is what I meant: the three mysteries serve as witnesses to his final repentance.

And I tell you truly: If he sins again after that, no mystery can forgive him. No repentance will be accepted from him—not by any mystery—except through the first mystery of the First Mystery or the mysteries of the Ineffable.

Only those highest and most merciful mysteries can still forgive him. Because they are always compassionate, always merciful, and always willing to forgive.”

## What it means

This chapter explores the tension between radical forgiveness and necessary boundaries. It affirms that we should give people many chances—as long as their longing for God is genuine. Even if they keep failing, as long as they’re not faking it, they deserve compassion, patience, and the mysteries.

But there’s a point—after repeated forgiveness and offerings—when someone’s continued sin becomes a hardened choice. At that point, the ordinary channels of grace (through the lower mysteries) no longer work. Only the highest mysteries—those directly connected to the Divine Heart—can reach them.

Jesus is outlining a spiritual version of what today we might call “tough love.” Not out of judgment, but out of clarity. He is showing that compassion must be paired with wisdom. And that some healing must come from a higher source, beyond what we as individuals can offer.

## Reflection

* How do you know when someone is genuinely longing for the Light and not just going through the motions?
* Have you ever struggled to know when to keep forgiving—and when to set boundaries?
* How does this teaching challenge or affirm your own views of mercy?
