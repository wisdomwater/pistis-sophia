# Chapter 114 — Jesus Encourages Mary to Question Freely

When I, Mary, spoke these words, the Lord Jesus responded to me:
“Well said, all-blessed Mary, spiritual one. These answers resolve the words I have spoken.”

Yet still, my heart urged me on, and I said,
“My Lord, I will continue to question you, and from now on I will question you about all things with certainty. So please, be patient with us and reveal all that we ask, so that my brothers may learn how to proclaim it to all humankind.”

Hearing this, the Saviour looked upon me with deep compassion and said:
“Amen, amen, I tell you truly: Not only will I reveal all things you question me about, but I will also reveal things you have not yet thought to ask—things that have never entered the heart of man, and which even all the gods below humanity do not know. So, Mary, ask what you will, and I will reveal it to you directly, without using any metaphor or likeness.”

## What it means

This chapter marks a pivotal moment of trust and openness between Mary and the Saviour. Mary’s boldness to question everything is met with loving patience and a promise of full disclosure, even of mysteries beyond human imagination or the knowledge of lesser gods.

The Saviour’s readiness to reveal “face to face without similitude” suggests a direct, unfiltered transmission of divine truth—not veiled in parables or symbols, but made clear and immediate. This openness invites sincere seekers to bring their deepest questions without fear, emphasizing the unfolding nature of spiritual revelation.

It also highlights the role of Mary as a devoted seeker and teacher, who will carry this revealed wisdom to others, guiding humanity toward greater understanding.

* How comfortable are you with receiving answers that might be completely new or beyond your current understanding?
* In what ways can you cultivate patience and openness to ongoing revelation in your own life?
