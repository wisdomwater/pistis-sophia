## Chapter 121 — Keep Watch, for the Light is Holy

Jesus said to his disciples,
“Do you understand the meaning of what I am saying to you?”

And I, Mary, answered him:
“Yes, my Lord. I have listened with full attention to every word you have spoken. What you say reminds me of what you told us before: ‘If the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.’”

When I said this, the Lord replied, “Well said, you spiritual Mary. That is the right understanding.”

Then the Savior turned to all the disciples and said: “Now, go and proclaim this to all who receive the mysteries of the Light: Stay awake—be watchful over your soul! Do not sin, lest you add wrongdoing upon wrongdoing, and depart from your body without repentance.  If that happens, you will become strangers to the Kingdom of Light forever.”

And I, Mary, said again:
“My Lord, how great is the compassion of these mysteries,  that they forgive sins again and again, every time!”

Jesus answered me in the presence of the others:
“Mary, if an earthly king—a mere man—can give pardon, even to those guilty of terrible crimes like murder or sexual immorality, how much more can the Ineffable and the First Mystery—
the lords of all universes—grant forgiveness to those who receive their mysteries?

Look at it this way:
If a worldly king clothes a soldier with his royal garments and sends him into foreign lands, and even if that soldier commits crimes worthy of death, he is still protected—no one punishes him— because he wears the king’s own garments.

How much more, then, will those who wear the spiritual vestures of the Ineffable and the First Mystery be protected! They are clothed not just with royal garments, but with the light of the highest realms— above all heavens, above all depths.”

### What it means

This chapter is both a warning and a promise.

The warning: Stay awake. Don’t take the mysteries lightly.
If you receive sacred knowledge but live carelessly, you risk being caught unprepared— like a house broken into at night.

But the promise is just as strong: The mercy of the Ineffable is beyond human comprehension. If worldly kings can forgive—even protect the guilty— how much more will the Lords of Light show mercy
to those who wear their mysteries in sincerity?

Clothed in divine mystery,
you carry heaven's authority.
Not to abuse it—but to walk in trust, gratitude, and humility.

### Reflection

* Are you living like a watchful householder—or have you let your spiritual guard down?
* What does it mean to “wear the mysteries”? How can you honor that gift daily?
* Do you believe that mercy is available to you, even now? What holds you back from receiving it fully?
