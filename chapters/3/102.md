# Chapter 102 — The Path to the Light: What to Renounce and What to Embrace

Jesus continued teaching his disciples and said:

"When I return to the Light, spread this message to the whole world: Never stop seeking—day and night—until you find the mysteries of the Kingdom of Light. These mysteries will purify you, transform you into radiant light, and lead you home to the Light.

Tell everyone: Let go of the world and everything that binds you to it—its material concerns, its sins, its attachments. Let go of everything that keeps you from the Light, so that you can become worthy to receive its mysteries and escape the suffering caused by judgment.

Renounce:

* Complaining and negativity—so you can avoid the fires of the beast with a dog’s face.
* Gossip and spying—so you can escape judgment.
* Arguments and quarrels—so you can avoid punishment by Ariel.
* Lying and slander—so you’re not thrown into the rivers of fire.
* False testimony—so you can escape burning judgment.
* Pride and arrogance—so you don’t fall into Ariel’s fire pits.
* Gluttony—so you escape the judgment of Amente.
* Foolish talk—so you avoid the fires of Amente.
* Manipulation and deceit—so you’re spared from Amente’s punishments.
* Greed—so you escape the rivers of fire.
* Love of worldly things—so you don’t wear a coat of pitch and fire.
* Stealing and violence—so you avoid the wrath of Ariel and Yaldabaoth.
* Cruel words and evil intentions—so you don’t end up in fiery judgment.

Also, give up:

* Cruelty and lack of compassion—so you can escape the dragon-faced ones.
* Anger and rage—so you’re not swept into the fire rivers.
* Cursing, theft, and murder—so you avoid being judged by lion-, dragon-, and crocodile-faced rulers of the underworld.
* Lovelessness, impiety, atheism, sorcery, blasphemy, and false teachings—so you’re not lost in the cold and darkness forever.

Warn those who spread false teachings: If you don't turn back, your fate is worse than others—you'll disappear into eternal darkness and never return.

But now tell the people of the world what *to do* to enter the Light:

* Be calm.
* Show kindness to others.
* Be gentle.
* Be peaceful.
* Be merciful.
* Give to those in need.
* Care for the sick and suffering.
* Love God.
* Be just.
* Do good.
* Let go of everything that binds you.

These are the traits of those who are ready to receive the mysteries of the Light.

And when you meet those who are willing to renounce the world and follow these ways—even if they’ve sinned in the past—don’t withhold the mysteries from them. This is why I came: to bring the mysteries that forgive sins and make a new beginning possible.

As I said before: I didn’t come to call the righteous, but those who need healing. These mysteries are the gift of the First Mystery, given to wash away all wrongs and lead people back into the Light."

## What it means

This chapter is like a spiritual guidebook. Jesus gives a long list of things to renounce—pride, anger, greed, cruelty, deception—and a list of virtues to embrace—gentleness, compassion, mercy, peace, and care for others.

But the key message isn’t just about following rules. It’s about seeking transformation.

Even if someone has done every wrong listed, they are not condemned if they choose to turn, to seek the Light, and to live differently. The “mysteries” Jesus speaks of are spiritual teachings and initiations that cleanse and elevate the soul. They’re not reserved for the perfect—but offered as a path to those ready to begin again.

The message is clear: Let go of what drags you down, and take on what helps you rise. The Light is waiting for all who genuinely seek it.

## Reflection

* Which qualities on the list of renunciations feel most challenging to you? Why?
* Are there areas in your life where you're holding on to worldly attachments that block your spiritual growth?
* Do you believe spiritual transformation is possible for everyone, even those who've deeply fallen?
