## Chapter 123 – When a Soul Falls and Rises Again

And Mary asked the Lord, “My Lord, if someone has received mysteries but did not live in a way worthy of them, and if that person later sinned— but afterward came back in deep repentance— can we renew for them the same mystery they had before? Or should we instead give them a lower mystery? Is this allowed?”

And Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you: Neither the same mystery they received before, nor a lower mystery, can forgive their sin.

But— only a higher mystery than the one they had received has the power to hear thei repentance and forgive them.

So, Mary, tell your brothers: Give such a soul a mystery higher than the one they received before. Accept their repentance. Forgive their sin. The former mystery cannot help them now, but the higher one will—because they have risen up and sought more Light.”

He continued: “But if someone has already received the three great mysteries of the two outer spaces and the third space inward— and then falls again into sin— neither the higher nor the lower mysteries will help him. Only the mystery of the First Mystery or the mysteries of the Ineffable can accept such a one’s repentance and forgive his sins.”

Then Mary asked again, “My Lord, what about a man who has received two or three mysteries  
in the second or third space— and has not sinned or faked his faith, but remains sincere and upright?”

And the Lord said, “Such a man—faithful and true— is free to receive any mystery he desires,  
from the first to the last. Nothing is withheld from one who has walked in truth without deceit.”

### What it means

This chapter draws a beautiful and sobering distinction:

When we fall after receiving a mystery, we can’t simply go back to where we were— we must rise higher.

True repentance requires ascending to greater Light, because the soul must stretch itself beyond its old limits and become new again.

But if we are faithful— if we walk in honesty and sincerity, without deception or hypocrisy— then no gate is shut to us. Every mystery is open to the faithful heart.

### Reflection

* Have you ever tried to go back to something safe instead of pressing forward into growth?
* How does knowing that only a higher mystery can restore you change the way you think about repentance?
* What would it look like to walk in your faith “without play-acting” today?
