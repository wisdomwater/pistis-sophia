## Chapter 119 – The Weight of Sacred Gifts and the Mercy Beyond Limits

Mary continued to ask,  
“My Lord, what happens if someone receives the mysteries of the First Mystery, but then turns away, sins, and dies before repenting? Will they still inherit the kingdom because they received the gift?”

The Lord answered her, “Truly, truly, I say to you: If someone who received the mysteries of the First Mystery sins once, twice, or even three times, and then dies before repenting - their judgment is harsher than all other judgments.
Such a soul will dwell in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness, and in the end they will be frozen and destroyed forever in its punishments - because they received the holy gift and did not remain faithful to it.”

Then Mary asked,  
“My Lord, what about those who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, but later turn away, lose faith, and sin again? If they are still alive and turn back once more—how many times will they be forgiven?”

Jesus replied,  
“Truly, truly, I say to you: Anyone who has received the mysteries of the Ineffable will be forgiven as many times as they truly repent— not just once. Even if they fall again, and again, and again— so long as they turn back without pretense and sincerely pray within any of their mysteries, they will always be forgiven. Because they have received from the gift of the Ineffable, and those mysteries are filled with boundless compassion—they forgive every time.”

Mary asked again,  
“My Lord, what if someone receives the mysteries of the Ineffable, but sins, loses faith, and dies before repenting? What happens to them?”

The Lord answered,  
“Truly, truly, I say to you: Those who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable are greatly blessed. But if they turn away and die before repenting,  
their judgment will be harsher than all judgments—violent and final. Even if it was their first life in the world, they will not return to another body, nor be given another chance. They will be cast into the outer darkness, and they will perish—becoming nothing forever.”

### What it means

This chapter presents a sobering paradox: the more sacred the gift, the greater the responsibility.

Receiving the mysteries of the First Mystery is like being entrusted with sacred fire—if misused or abandoned, the consequences are grave. There is mercy, but it is limited. Up to three transgressions are forgivable—but only if repentance happens before death.

But the mysteries of the Ineffable operate on a completely different level. They are vessels of infinite compassion, and as long as a soul is still alive and sincere, there is always a path back. The key is sincerity—no play-acting, no pretense.

Yet even with this infinite mercy, if a soul receives these highest mysteries and then dies without repentance, the judgment is total. There is no second chance in another life. The soul dissolves into non-existence—a return not to punishment, but to utter loss of being.

The teaching invites both awe and reverence: to receive divine mysteries is not a casual event. It's a holy covenant.

### Reflection

* What sacred gifts or insights have you been entrusted with—and are you living in alignment with them?
* How does the idea of “infinite forgiveness while alive” sit with you? Does it comfort or challenge you?
* What might it look like in your life to return sincerely—not with guilt, but with trust in divine compassion?
