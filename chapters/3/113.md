## Chapter 113 — Mary's Four Thoughts

When the Master had finished his teaching, he asked us, “Do you understand the way I am speaking to you?”

I, Mary, stepped forward and answered him: “Yes, my Lord. I understand the way you speak to me, and I will comprehend everything you reveal. As you spoke, four thoughts arose within me. My inner light rejoiced and stirred, longing to leave my body and unite with yours. Let me share these four thoughts with you.

The first thought came from what you said—that when a soul ascends, it gives an apology and a seal to the rulers of the realm of Adamas, and gives honor and glory to the region of the Light. My heart remembered the day they brought you a coin. You saw it was made of both silver and copper. You asked whose image was on it, and they said, ‘The king’s.’ And you said, ‘Give the king what is the king’s, and give God what is God’s.’

To me, this meant the soul is like that coin—part silver, part copper. The silver is the power of the Light, the copper is the counterfeiting spirit. And when the soul has received the mysteries, it returns what is due: apologies and seals to the rulers, and honor and praise to the Light. This was my first thought.

The second thought came from your teaching about the soul that has received the mysteries and travels through the realms. The rulers of the way of the midst are terrified by it. The soul gives fear to those who are owed fear, destiny to its region, the counterfeiting spirit to its place, and seals and praise to the Light. This reminded me of the words spoken by our brother Paul: ‘Give tax to whom tax is due, fear to whom fear is due, tribute to whom tribute is due, and honor to whom honor is due. Owe nothing to anyone.’

This, to me, means that the soul gives to each region what it is owed. It fulfills every obligation and is free. That was my second thought.

The third thought came from your earlier words—that the counterfeiting spirit is always hostile to the soul. It leads the soul into every sin, every misdeed, and even into punishment. You once said, ‘The enemies of a man are those of his own house.’

So I saw that the counterfeiting spirit and destiny are the enemies within the soul’s own house. They live in the soul while it is in the body, and they war against it from within. That is my third thought.

The fourth thought came from your words that if a soul travels with the counterfeiting spirit after death and does not know the mystery that frees it, then it is taken to the Virgin of Light, who judges it. If she finds the soul without the Light's mysteries, she hands it over to her servant, who casts it back into another body. And the soul is trapped in the cycle of birth and death until it fulfills its last destined circuit.

This made me remember what you said to us before: ‘Make peace with your adversary while you are still with him on the road, or he may deliver you to the judge, and the judge hand you to the servant, and the servant throw you in prison. You won’t get out until you’ve paid the last coin.’

So I understand, my Lord, that this means the soul must reconcile with its inner enemies while still in the body. If not, the soul is judged and thrown back into the world again and again until it has fulfilled every last requirement. This, my Lord, is my fourth thought.”

### What it means

In this chapter, Mary speaks not just as a disciple but as a voice of the awakened soul. She interprets Jesus’ teachings using vivid memories and metaphors, connecting cosmic mysteries with everyday parables and sayings. Her insights show how the soul must offer to each realm what it is owed—not out of fear, but in order to be released from the bonds that hold it.

Mary’s image of the coin reminds us that we are both Light and matter. We must return what belongs to the world and what belongs to the Spirit. She also reveals the constant inner battle with the counterfeiting spirit and destiny—forces that live within us and tempt us away from the soul’s path. The way to freedom is not to deny them, but to understand, disarm, and release them through spiritual practice and inner truth.

Mary’s final thought is a deep warning filled with compassion: if we do not find freedom in this life—through reconciliation, awakening, and knowledge—we remain bound to the cycles of rebirth and suffering. We must make peace with what haunts us while we still can.

### Reflection

* What do you still “owe” to the rulers of your inner world—old patterns, fears, or judgments that need to be released?
* Can you see where the counterfeiting spirit and destiny have lived in your “house”? How do they try to steer your actions?
* What steps can you take now, while “on the road,” to make peace with your adversaries within?
