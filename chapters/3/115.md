## Chapter 115 — Mary Asks About the Power of Baptism to Forgive Sins

I, Mary, spoke to the Master with a question burning in my heart:  
“My Lord, in what way do the baptisms truly forgive sins? I have heard you say that the retributive servitors follow the soul, bearing witness to every sin it commits so they can accuse it in judgment. So, my Lord, do the mysteries of baptism wipe away these sins, causing the servitors to forget them? Please, we desire to know for certain how the forgiveness happens.”

The Saviour answered me, “Well spoken, Mary. Indeed, the servitors are those who witness all sins. They remain in the chaotic realms, seizing souls who have not received the mysteries. These souls are held tightly in chaos and punished accordingly. The servitors cannot cross beyond this chaos to reach the higher realms, nor can they accuse souls who have come out of these lower regions.

It is not lawful to force souls who have received the mysteries into chaos, so the servitors cannot convict them. The servitors only have power over souls who have not received the mysteries—they hold them captive in chaos and chastise them.

Now, listen closely: when a soul sins while still in the world, the servitors bear witness to these sins to prevent the soul from escaping the chaos and facing judgment beyond it. The counterfeiting spirit also witnesses every sin the soul commits, to accuse it in those higher judgments. Furthermore, the counterfeiting spirit seals the sins tightly onto the soul, marking it so that the rulers who punish sinners will know both the soul’s guilt and the number of sins committed.

This is the fate of all sinning souls.

But now, Mary, when a soul receives the mysteries of baptism, the mystery itself becomes a great, fierce, and wise fire. This fire burns away all the sins the counterfeiting spirit has sealed onto the soul. It secretly enters the soul and consumes these sins entirely.

After purifying the soul, this fire enters the body and silently pursues all that pursues the soul—namely, the counterfeiting spirit and destiny. It separates these dark forces away from the soul’s power and places them on the side of the body.

Thus, baptism divides the soul and its power from the counterfeiting spirit, destiny, and the body. The mystery of baptism remains in the middle, continually keeping these parts separated, cleansing and purifying them so they are not stained or corrupted by matter.

This, Mary, is how the mysteries of baptism forgive all sins and iniquities.”

### What it means

In this chapter, Mary asks a fundamental question about how spiritual cleansing truly works. The Saviour’s response reveals a profound spiritual process: sins are not merely forgotten but are witnessed and sealed by cosmic forces as a record of the soul’s misdeeds.

However, the mystery of baptism acts like a purifying fire that burns away these sins from the soul, freeing it from the binding seals placed by the counterfeiting spirit. More than just forgiveness, baptism is a cosmic separation—a division between the soul’s true power and the forces of corruption and fate that cling to the body and lower self.

This cleansing allows the soul to rise beyond the chaos and judgment of the lower realms. The spiritual fire of baptism is a dynamic, ongoing process that keeps the soul clean and unstained by matter, helping it to remain connected to the Light.

### Reflection

* How do you understand the concept of sins being “sealed” onto the soul? What might these seals represent in your life?
* In what ways do you experience spiritual “fire” or cleansing that separates you from destructive habits or influences?
* What does it mean to you that baptism (or spiritual purification) is an ongoing process that continuously keeps your soul clean from corruption?
