## Chapter 122 — A Test of Mercy

One day, a woman came again to make repentance. Jesus had already baptized her three times, but still, she had not lived in a way that honored the mysteries she had received. So the Lord used this moment to test Peter’s heart.

He said to him, “Peter, look—this soul has received baptism three times, but even now, she still has not done what is worthy of the Light. Why does she waste her body like this? Now, go ahead and perform the mystery that cuts souls off from inheriting the Kingdom of Light. Do it now—cut her off.”

But this was only a test. Jesus wanted to see if Peter had learned the lesson of compassion.

Peter replied, “My Lord, let’s give her one more chance. Let her receive the higher mysteries. If she proves herself worthy, she can still inherit the Kingdom. But if not—then you can cut her off.”

And when Jesus heard this, he knew Peter had truly become compassionate and forgiving, just as he had been taught.

Then he asked all the disciples, “Do you understand what just happened, and what this woman represents?”

And I, Mary, spoke up again. “Yes, my Lord, I understand. You spoke about this before through a parable:

‘A man planted a fig tree in his vineyard. For three years, he came looking for fruit but found none. So he told the gardener, “Cut it down. Why waste good soil?”  

But the gardener replied, “Let me care for it one more year. I’ll dig around it, give it nourishment. If it bears fruit next year, we’ll keep it. But if not, then you can cut it down.”’

This story, Lord, is the story of this woman’s soul.”

And Jesus said, “Well said, Mary—you are truly a spiritual soul. This is the meaning of what has happened.”

### What it means

This chapter reminds us that divine judgment is always tempered by mercy-and that true disciples must embody that same mercy.

Even when someone fails again and again, there is still space for one more year, one more chance. Jesus tests Peter to see if he has absorbed this compassion. And Peter passes the test—not by strict justice,
but by grace.

Mary, once again, discerns the hidden truth beneath the surface: this woman is like the fig tree—slow to bear fruit, but not beyond redemption.

The message is clear:
Patience. Forgiveness. A heart like the Gardener.

### Reflection

* Have you ever felt like the fig tree—given chances, but slow to bear fruit?
* Who in your life might need “one more year” of grace from you?
* Can you see failure not as final, but as an invitation to deeper transformation?
