## Chapter 112 — The Ascension of the Worthy Soul

Jesus continued teaching:

If a soul has not listened to the counterfeiting spirit—that is, if it lived rightly and received the mysteries of the Light from the second or third (inner) level—then when it leaves the body at death, both the counterfeiting spirit and the destiny spirit follow it on its upward journey.

But before the soul can ascend, it must speak the mystery that breaks the seals and bindings the rulers placed on it through the counterfeiting spirit. Once the soul speaks this mystery, the bonds break apart, and the counterfeiting spirit detaches and releases the soul as it was instructed to do by the rulers of Fate.

When the soul speaks the mystery, it also sends the destiny spirit back to its place among the rulers of the middle, and the counterfeiting spirit back to the region where it belongs.

At this point, the soul becomes a brilliant stream of light, shining so intensely that even the retributive spirits who had come to escort it fall down in fear. The soul transforms into radiant light-wings and flies through all the realms and hierarchies of the Light until it reaches the place of its inheritance, as far as the mysteries it received allow.

But if a soul had received the outer mysteries and then turned back to sin after fulfilling them, the process is more difficult.

At death, the soul is met again by retributive receivers, followed by its destiny and counterfeiting spirit. Though the soul still has power to speak the mysteries and dissolve the bindings, it is no longer fully in control—it is now vulnerable to these forces.

Even so, the Light-receivers arrive with the mysteries it had once received and rescue the soul from the hands of the retributive spirits. These Light-beings become wings of light for the soul, wrapping it in garments of light. Because it once received divine mysteries, this soul is not thrown into chaos.

Instead, it is led through the realm of the rulers of the middle, who approach with terrifying faces and burning flames. But the soul speaks a mystery of protection, and the rulers fall down in fear. The soul then declares:

*“Take back your destiny! I no longer belong to this region. I am going to my true home.”*

With that, the Light-receivers lift the soul higher, leading it through the realms of Fate. At each stop, the soul gives the appropriate apologies, seals, and mysteries, declaring to each region:

*“Here is your counterfeiting spirit. I do not return to you. I am now a stranger to this world.”*

Eventually, the soul reaches the Virgin of Light, where she and her seven sister-virgins examine the soul. They find their signs within it—their seals, baptisms, and anointings—and bless it. The soul is baptized and anointed with spirit-oil, and each of the virgins marks it with her seal.

The soul is then brought to Sabaoth the Good, known as the “Father,” who stands at the entrance to the Life of the Right. The soul offers him its songs of praise, its knowledge, and its sacred seals. He blesses it, and so do all the righteous beings of the Light.

Finally, Melchizedek, the great Receiver of Light, seals the soul and leads it into the Treasury of the Light, where it offers its praise and is welcomed into its eternal inheritance.

### What it means

This chapter offers a vision of two contrasting post-death journeys:

1. The soul that lives in truth and receives mysteries ascends freely through the heavenly realms, shedding the bindings of fate and deception. It shines brightly, flies on wings of light, and is honored and sealed at each realm of Light.

2. The soul that received divine truths but returned to sin must still confront spiritual forces but is ultimately rescued due to the sacred mysteries it once embraced. It too ascends, though with more struggle.

At the heart of the message is this: *Divine knowledge liberates the soul*. But not only knowledge—living according to the Light is what truly empowers the soul to shed the bindings of the world and return to its true home.

Each realm, each ruler, each opposing force demands a kind of “receipt”—a seal, an apology, a mystery. These symbols show that the soul has awakened, remembered, and reclaimed its divine origin. The soul can now say: “I am no longer yours. I belong to the Light.”

### Reflection

* What do you think the "counterfeiting spirit" represents in your own life? Are there thoughts or habits that pretend to be you, but lead you away from your highest good?
* Have you experienced moments of awakening that felt like reclaiming your soul?
* If you were to write a declaration today like the soul does—"I am going to my inheritance"—what would that inheritance be? What are you walking towards or away from?
