## Chapter 118 — On the Limits of Forgiveness and the Depths of Grace

After the Lord had spoken, he turned to us and asked,  
“Do you understand the way I am speaking to you?”

I, Mary, responded:  
“Yes, my Lord, I understand the meaning of your words.”

And I offered this interpretation:  
“You said that all the mysteries of the Three Spaces forgive sins and cover iniquities. This reminds me of what David the prophet wrote long ago:  

‘Blessed are they whose sins are forgiven and whose iniquities are covered.’

And you said, ‘The mystery of the First Mystery and the mystery of the Ineffable forgive not only all sins from the beginning but also will never again count any sins against the soul from this hour into all eternity.’  
David also spoke of this, saying:  

‘Blessed are those to whom the Lord God will not impute sin.’
 
That is, no sins will ever be counted against those who have received the mysteries of the First Mystery and of the Ineffable.”

And the Lord said to me,  
“Well said, Mary—you who are spiritual and pure in the Light. You have rightly understood.”

Then I asked him another question:  
“My Lord, suppose a person receives the mysteries of the First Mystery, but later sins again and transgresses. If they repent and pray within one of the mysteries they received, will their sin be forgiven?”

And the Lord answered me,  
“Truly, truly, I say to you:  
If a person who has received the mysteries of the First Mystery turns back to sin,  
and then repents and prays—even up to twelve times—each time, forgiveness will be given.

But if they go beyond twelve and continue to sin and turn away again and again,  
then forgiveness will no longer be given—not by any mystery they have received.  
Such a soul cannot repent again unless they receive the mysteries of the Ineffable,  
which are filled with infinite compassion and always offer forgiveness—no matter how many times.”

### What it means

This chapter reveals both the depth of divine mercy and the seriousness of our spiritual choices.

Mary connects Jesus’ teaching with the ancient psalms of David—showing that what was once a hidden hope is now made fully known. The greater mysteries don't just erase our past—they change how heaven sees us going forward. We are no longer defined by sin.

But Jesus also draws a line. Even with such grace, the soul must genuinely turn toward the Light. There’s a limit—twelve times—where the First Mystery will still offer forgiveness to those who stumble and return. After that, it requires an even deeper mystery—the Ineffable, the ultimate source of compassion that never withholds grace, no matter how often we fall.

This shows the gradual unfolding of divine mercy: from cleansing, to transformation, to limitless compassion.

### Reflection

* What does it mean to *receive* a mystery—mentally? Spiritually? Physically?
* Have you ever felt like you "used up" grace—or doubted if it was still available to you?
* What would it feel like to be held by a forgiveness that *never runs out*?
