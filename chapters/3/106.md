# Chapter 106 — Radical Longing, Real Discernment, and the Limits of Human Mercy

After Jesus had finished speaking, John continued his questioning:

“Lord, let’s say there’s someone who has lived a deeply sinful life—but now he has completely renounced the world, its cares, its attachments, and all its sins. We’ve tested him and we’re certain he’s not pretending. He truly longs for God and lives with honesty and devotion. Suppose he is worthy of receiving the mysteries of the second or third space—should we give those to him before he receives any mysteries of the Inheritance of the Light? Or should we wait?”

Jesus replied to John and the disciples:

“If you know with certainty that this man has fully renounced the world and its attachments, and that he’s not deceiving you or trying to learn the mysteries out of curiosity—but is truly longing for God—do not withhold the mysteries of the second and third space from him.

Test him, and whatever level he is ready for, give it to him. Don’t hold back what he’s worthy of, or you yourselves may fall into condemnation.

But take heed: if you give him one of these higher mysteries, and he later falls into sin again, you may still forgive and give again—up to three times. After that, if he still sins, stop. Those three mysteries will stand as witnesses of his last chance to repent.

And I tell you clearly: anyone who gives him more mysteries after the third time is bringing judgment upon themselves. At that point, he must be treated as someone who has rejected the path—a transgressor and a stumbling-block.

The soul of that person will no longer return to the upper worlds. From that moment on, it will dwell in the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness—a place of howling and grinding teeth. At the end of the world, his soul will be destroyed—consumed by extreme cold and intense fire, and it will cease to exist forever.

Even if he later turns back again, renounces everything, and repents sincerely, no ordinary mystery will be able to accept his repentance or forgive his sins. Only the First Mystery and the Mysteries of the Ineffable—the highest and most merciful realms—can receive him and forgive him.

For those mysteries are always compassionate, always forgiving, and full of mercy, no matter the time.”

## What it means

This chapter takes the mercy-versus-boundaries theme even deeper. It affirms that someone who has genuinely turned away from the world and longs for God should never be denied the Light they are ready to receive—even if their past is deeply flawed.

But it also issues a solemn warning: mercy must be balanced with discernment. Forgiveness is offered *three times* for those who fall back into sin after receiving high mysteries. But beyond that, human-level mysteries lose their power. Only the highest Divine Mercy can reach them.

Spiritually, this is a lesson about the limits of our role as guides, teachers, or helpers. There comes a point when only God can touch a soul that keeps returning to the darkness. Our job is to offer the Light while it's still possible—but also to recognize when someone must face the consequences of their repeated choices.

The chapter also emphasizes that the First Mystery and the Ineffable (symbolizing God’s ultimate, unknowable mercy) never stop forgiving. This gives hope even in the most hopeless cases—but places the responsibility in Divine hands, not ours.

## Reflection

* Have you ever struggled to discern when to keep helping someone and when to let go?
* What do you think it means to “long for God in truth”? How can we know that in ourselves or others?
* How do you relate to the idea that only the highest, Divine-level mystery can forgive certain kinds of repeated transgressions?
