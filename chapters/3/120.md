## Chapter 120 — Salt That Has Lost Its Flavor

Jesus asked his disciples again, “Do you understand what I am saying to you?”

Mary answered,  
“Yes, my Lord. I have understood. When you said, ‘Blessed are those who receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, but if they turn away and sin, and die without repentance, they will no longer return to the body or to anything at all— they will be cast into the outer darkness and cease to exist,’ this reminded me of something you said earlier: ‘Salt is good, but if it loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor the manure pile—it is thrown away." That is, those who receive the great mysteries are like salt, but if they turn away, they become useless, not fit for earth or even the waste pile—so they are cast out.”

Jesus said to her,  
“Well said, you spiritual and pure light-filled Mary. This is the meaning of that saying.”

Then Mary continued,  
“My Lord, what about those who received the mysteries of the First Mystery and the Ineffable— who did not fake their faith, who truly believed— but who still sinned later because of the influence of Fate? If they turn again, repent, and pray in their mysteries, how often will they be forgiven?”

Jesus replied,  
“Truly, truly, I say to you: Anyone who receives the mysteries of the Ineffable and the First Mystery and sins—if they repent while still alive and turn back to their mysteries— they will be forgiven every time. Because those mysteries are full of compassion, and they forgive endlessly. This is why I told you before: They forgive not only all past sins, but do not even hold new sins against them from that moment on. As long as they are alive and repent sincerely, they are covered by mercy.”

“But,” he continued, “if someone receives these mysteries and dies without repenting, they will be treated like all others who died in sin: they will be swallowed by the jaws of the dragon of outer darkness— they will perish and become nothing forever.

This is why I said to you: If people knew when they would die, they would be far more careful not to sin, so they could inherit the Kingdom of Light forever.”

### What it means

This chapter weaves together two central ideas:
responsibility and grace.

Those who receive divine mysteries are entrusted with something immensely powerful—like salt preserving the earth. But with that power comes the possibility of losing it through neglect or betrayal. If one falls away and dies without repentance, the judgment is severe: complete separation from the Light.

Yet, the mercy of these mysteries is also immense.
As long as someone is alive, even if they fall again and again—they can return. Sins born of weakness, pressure, or Fate are not counted against the truly faithful who turn back. Forgiveness is unlimited while there is life.

Jesus' final words echo a deep truth: if we truly grasped how fleeting life is, we would live differently—with greater intention, care, and love.

### Reflection

* Are there ways you’ve “lost your saltiness”—areas where you’ve neglected the sacred trust placed in you?
* Do you truly believe you can return again and again—and be fully forgiven?
* How would your life change if you lived as if each moment might be your last?
