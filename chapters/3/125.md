# Chapter 125 — The Danger of Delay

Mary continued again and said to the Lord: “My Lord, if the faith and the mysteries have been revealed, but souls, returning again and again through many lifetimes, delay receiving the mysteries— thinking they’ll do so in a future life— are they not in danger of missing the opportunity entirely?”

The Lord answered and said to his disciples: “Proclaim this to the whole world: Strive now, in this time of affliction, to receive the mysteries of the Light and enter the Light-Kingdom. Do not delay, putting it off from one day to another, or from one life to the next, thinking you will succeed in receiving them later.

They do not know the moment when the number of the perfect souls will be fulfilled. When that moment comes, I will shut the gates of the Light. No one will enter, and no one will leave. The First Mystery, for whose sake the universe exists,
will be complete— and I am that Mystery.

Before the fire comes to purify the cosmos— the aeons, veils, firmaments, and the earth itself— people will still be living. At that time, the faith and the mysteries will become even more visible in the world.

And many souls, through repeated lives, will finally find the Light and receive its mysteries— even some of those who hear me now. But they will come to the gates and find them already shut, the number complete, the work finished.

They will knock and cry out: ‘Lord, open to us!’ And I will say: ‘I do not know you, or where you are from.’ They will plead: ‘We received your mysteries! We followed your teachings! You taught us in the streets!’ But I will reply: ‘I do not know you. You are workers of darkness and evil. Depart from me into the outer darkness.’ And they will go out into that place where there is weeping and grinding of teeth.

This is why you must proclaim to all: ‘Renounce the world and all its entanglements. Strive to receive the mysteries now— before the number of the perfect is complete— lest you be turned away at the gates and cast into the outer darkness.’

Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

When the Lord had said this, Mary stepped forward and said: “My Lord, not only has my inner light heard, but my soul has understood everything you said. Concerning your words— ‘Proclaim to the world: Strive now to receive the Light…’”

## What it means

This is a solemn warning about procrastination in the spiritual path. We may be tempted to delay transformation, telling ourselves there will be more time, more lifetimes, more chances. But the gates of Light do not remain open forever. There is a sacred fullness—when the work is done, the number complete.

It is not enough to hear or to claim outward affiliation. The Light looks for those who embody its truth with sincerity. Even souls who once received mysteries can miss the Kingdom if they do not live by them.

This is not said to frighten, but to awaken. The call is urgent: now is the time.

## Reflection

* In what ways have you delayed your inner transformation?
* Do you treat your spiritual journey with urgency and devotion?
* What does it mean to truly be “known” by the Light?
