## Chapter 7 — The Light Returns, and So Do You

Jesus continued:

“When the sun rose in the east, a great moment came. Through the First Mystery—the divine origin from which the universe was born and from which I have now come once again—I was given back my radiant robe of light.”

“This Vesture of Light had been mine from the beginning. I left it behind in the highest of the hidden mysteries—the twenty-fourth mystery—in the innermost realms of divine reality. I had to wait until the right time to wear it again. Now that the time is fulfilled, I have put it on so I can speak with humanity face to face—from the innermost truths to the outermost appearances, and back again.”

“Rejoice, because you are the first to receive this unveiling of truth—from beginning to end.”

Then he said something extraordinary about the disciples themselves:

“You were chosen from the beginning, through the First Mystery. When I came into the world, I brought twelve divine powers with me—gifts from the twelve saviors of the Treasury of Light. I placed each of these powers into your mothers’ wombs before you were born. These are the powers that live in your bodies today. You were chosen before the world began, because you are the ones who will help awaken it.”

“You have been given these inner powers so you can withstand the challenges and suffering the world and its rulers will bring. I have told you many times: you are not of this world, just as I am not. The rest of the world has souls shaped by the rulers of the material realms. But the power within you comes from me. Your souls are from the heights.”

“I took a portion of my own power and used it to create twelve powers—one for each of you. And when I came into the world, I passed through the rulers of the spheres, taking on the form of the angel Gabriel so they would not recognize me.”

Then Jesus explained something even deeper:

“When I came into the realms of the rulers, I looked down upon the human world, as the First Mystery commanded. I found Elizabeth—John the Baptist’s mother—before she conceived him. Into her I placed a divine power from the little Iao, the Good One who lives in the Midst, so that John would be able to prepare the way for me and baptize with water for the forgiveness of sins.”

“But that’s not all. Instead of the ordinary soul the world’s rulers would have assigned to John, I retrieved the soul of the prophet Elijah from the spheres. I took that soul to the Virgin of Light, and her angelic receivers delivered it to Elizabeth’s womb. So within John lived both the power from the divine Midst and the soul of Elijah.”

“That’s why you were confused when John said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ and you asked me, ‘Doesn’t Scripture say that Elijah must come first?’ And I told you, ‘Elijah has already come—they did what they pleased to him.’ You didn’t understand then that I meant the soul of Elijah was in John. But now I tell you openly: if you are willing to accept it—John the Baptist *was* Elijah.”

### What it means

This chapter is a deep unveiling of identity—Jesus's own, and also that of the disciples and John the Baptist.

Jesus reclaims his Vesture of Light, a symbol of divine fullness, glory, and authority. It represents the moment when hidden divinity becomes revealed. He no longer speaks in symbols—he speaks face to face, from heart to heart. This is about intimacy with truth.

And then he says something incredible: *You*, too, have divine power inside you. You are not just accidental beings. Your soul comes from a higher place, placed with intention. Even before birth, you were infused with purpose. You carry a spark of divine light meant to withstand the challenges of this world and awaken others.

John the Baptist’s story highlights the layered nature of identity. His soul is Elijah’s, his purpose is to prepare the way, and he holds a piece of the divine Midst within him. Jesus is helping us see: souls are more than personalities—they are stories, missions, light clothed in time.

Symbolically, this chapter invites us to remember that we, too, are more than we appear. We may have forgotten our Vesture of Light, but it waits for us, ready to be put on again when we’re prepared to walk in truth.

### Reflection

* What would it mean to believe that part of your soul comes from the divine Light—that you are not of this world, but sent into it with purpose?
* Can you identify moments in your life when something deeper in you felt “called”—like an ancient knowing awakening?
* What “robe of light” have you left behind, and what might it look like to begin putting it back on now?
