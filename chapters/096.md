## Chapter 96 — The Mystery of the Ineffable and the Soul’s Ascent into Divine Oneness

Jesus said to his disciples:

"I’m going to explain all of this to you more clearly—everything I've spoken of, all the beings who will rise, come forth, or be sent out; those who are above and within others; those in the realm of the First Mystery, and those near the space of the Ineffable. I’ll explain each realm and order when the universe expands. I'll reveal the mysteries that govern them and the supreme spiritual forces that rule over all their orders.

All of these are part of the great Mystery of the Ineffable. It is the source and purpose behind everything I’ve told you—and everything I haven’t yet revealed. This Mystery is the origin, journey, and fulfillment of all things. It is the One Mystery, the single word of the Ineffable, the ultimate knowing (gnosis) of the whole cosmic story.

And I’ll tell you about the structure of all the mysteries—their patterns, how they’re completed, and the mystery of the One and Only, the Ineffable. This mystery comes from the last part of the Ineffable and brings everything into being. It is the single word—the speech of the Ineffable—and it holds the key to understanding all that I have told you.

Anyone who receives this one true word of the Ineffable—along with all its forms and meanings—will know how to fulfill its mystery. Because you are perfect and trusted with all mysteries, you can grasp and live it. So now, listen closely as I reveal this mystery to you.

When someone receives this mystery and then leaves their earthly body, the heavenly beings who are meant to guide souls out of the material world will recognize them. But instead of guiding them, they will become overwhelmed by the light of that soul. The soul will shine so brightly that even these powerful beings will shrink back in awe and fear, unable to hold or follow it.

The soul will ascend swiftly through every level of existence. It won’t have to stop, give signs, or explain itself to any power or gatekeeper. No one will be able to stop it. Instead, all realms—from the rulers to the light-beings—will sing praises to it as it passes through, headed for its true home: the region of the One Mystery, where it will merge with the limbs (aspects) of the Ineffable itself.

And it will get there faster than an arrow can fly.

Let me tell you the truth: anyone who receives and fulfills this mystery may appear to be just a human being, but they will be greater than all the angels, archangels, rulers, lords, gods, light-bringers, the pure ones, the great forefathers, even the hidden invisible beings. They will surpass all who dwell in the treasury of light and rise completely above the entire cosmic mixture.

They will reign with me in the Light—not just alongside me, but as kings themselves. Though they are in the world, they are not of it.

In fact, I am that person, and that person is me.

At the end of the world, when the perfect souls are gathered and the universe is raised up, I will reign as king among all beings of Light. And all those who have received the mystery of the Ineffable will reign with me—on my right and left—because they are my equals in this great mystery.

That’s why I’ve never been ashamed to call you my brothers and companions. You will rule with me. This mystery is me, and I am this mystery.

All who receive it will reign. But your thrones, my twelve disciples, will be closest to mine because you will suffer more than any others for bringing this teaching to the world. Mary Magdalene and John the Virgin will also shine among all, seated near me, and yet your thrones will rise even higher.

And I say this too: anyone who finds the word of the Ineffable will understand all wisdom—every layer of truth, from the depths to the heights, the width and breadth of all creation. They will know how the world was formed, how the higher realms are structured, and where the universe truly came from."

### What it means

This chapter is like a hymn to ultimate union. The "mystery of the Ineffable" isn’t just a teaching—it is the secret name of God, the divine Word that brings all things into being and calls them home. To receive it is to become one with the divine source. This isn’t about intellect alone; it's about transformation.

The passage paints a mystical vision of the soul’s ascent—an image of profound liberation. A soul fully illuminated by divine mystery becomes untouchable by the lower powers. It moves freely, with no need to justify itself, because it is *Light*. In a world of judgment and gatekeepers, this is radical: the soul is not interrogated or blocked—it is praised and welcomed.

Spiritually and psychologically, this reflects a path of total integration and freedom. The soul who embraces the divine within transcends all hierarchical structures—religious, political, even spiritual. It becomes what it always truly was: a radiant aspect of the One.

Jesus’ repeated line—“That man is I, and I am that man”—reveals an invitation: this mystery is not just about him, but about *us*. When we awaken to it, we don’t just follow Jesus—we become like him. Not in ego, but in union. In Light.
