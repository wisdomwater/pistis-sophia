## Chapter 124 – The Weight of Knowing

Mary continued again and said to the Lord: “My Lord, if a person has come to know the Divine and has received the mysteries of the Light, but then turns away, sins, and refuses to repent— and another person, who has never known the Divine, also sins and lives in lawlessness— and both of them die, which of the two will suffer more in judgment?”

The Lord answered and said to her: “Truly, truly, I say to you: The one who knew the Divine and received the Light’s mysteries but did not turn back or repent will suffer far more severely in judgment than the one who was ignorant of the Divine and lived in sin. His suffering will be deeper and more intense than all others. Let those who have ears to hear, truly hear.”

When the Savior had said this, Mary stepped forward again and said: “My Lord, my inner being has ears, and I have understood all that you have spoken. Concerning this word, you spoke to us before in a parable, saying: ‘The servant who knew his master’s will but did not prepare or act on it will receive many blows. But the one who did not know and still acted wrongly will receive fewer.’

And again you said: ‘From the one to whom much is entrusted, much will be expected; and to the one who receives much, much will be required.’

This, my Lord, is the meaning of what you have just spoken: The person who has known the Divine and received the Light’s mysteries, but then sinned and refused to return, will suffer more than the one who never knew.”

### What it means

This teaching is a sobering reminder of spiritual responsibility. To receive divine mysteries is not simply a gift—it is a trust. The more insight, revelation, and grace we receive, the more we are called to live with integrity and fidelity.

Ignorance has its consequences, but conscious betrayal of truth cuts deeper. There is a sacred weight to knowing.

Yet even here, compassion whispers: If our hearts are stirred by this warning, then the Light is still calling us home.

### Reflection

* Are there areas in your life where you've turned from what you know to be true?
* How does this teaching challenge your sense of spiritual responsibility?
* In what ways can you honor the Light you’ve received more fully today?
