## Chapter 144 — The Chastisements of the Soul: Curser and Slanderer

Jesus continued teaching his disciples, describing the soul’s journey after death for those who have lived with harmful intent.

He said that when a person dies who has cursed others continually, their soul is first led to rivers and seas of fire, where it suffers for six months and eight days. Then it is brought through the path known as the “way of the midst,” where each ruler there inflicts their own punishments for another six months and eight days.

After this, the soul is brought before the Virgin of Light, who judges each soul according to its deeds—both good and evil. When the great sphere of time turns again, she hands the soul over to her servants, who carry it to a seething, purifying fire beneath the stars. This fire eats away at all that is impure.

Finally, Yaluham, a servant of Sabaōth the Adamas, gives the soul the cup of forgetfulness. The soul drinks, forgets everything it has experienced, and is cast back into a new body—one destined for a life filled with inner turmoil.

Then Mary asked Jesus, “What happens to the soul of one who constantly slanders others?”

Jesus replied that such a soul is first led by two receivers—Abiout and Charmōn—who guide it for three days, showing it the nature of the world. Then the soul is taken to Ariēl, ruler of the underworld called Ameute, and punished there for eleven months and twenty-one days.

Next, the soul is taken before Yaldabaōth and his 49 demons, who beat it with fiery whips for another eleven months and twenty-one days. It is then cast into boiling fire-rivers for the same length of time.

After these punishments, it is brought again through the way of the midst and judged by its rulers for another eleven months and twenty-one days. Eventually, it comes again to the Virgin of Light for final judgment. Once again, the soul is cast into the purifying fire beneath the sphere and then given the cup of forgetfulness. It is reborn into a life marked by suffering and difficulty.

This, Jesus said, is the punishment of the slanderer.

### What it means

This chapter doesn’t ask us to believe in literal fire-rivers or timelines but instead offers a symbolic framework for understanding the consequences of our words and intentions.

The "curser" and the "slanderer" represent two destructive patterns: the first poisons others through condemnation, and the second sows division through lies and defamation. The long, torturous journey of their souls reflects the deep psychological and spiritual damage these patterns cause—not just to others, but within the soul of the person who enacts them.

The fires and punishments symbolize the inner torment and fragmentation that comes from living disconnected from truth and compassion. The soul is repeatedly broken down, layer by layer, until what remains can be purified and reborn.

The cup of forgetfulness is symbolic of a fresh start. Even after all this wandering and pain, there is the chance to begin again—albeit with the deep work of healing still ahead. The new body and afflicted life reflect the unresolved pain that continues until full awakening.

### Reflection

* In what ways do my words shape the energy I carry and spread in the world?
* Are there patterns of anger, judgment, or gossip that need to be released in me?
* How can I offer myself and others a path toward healing, rather than punishment?
