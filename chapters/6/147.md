## Chapter 147 — Justice, Mercy, and the Uninitiated Soul

Bartholomew asked Jesus, “What happens to a man who has sexual relations with another man?”

Jesus replied, “His judgment is the same as that of the blasphemer. When his time on earth is complete, the servants of Yaldabaoth come for his soul. He and his 49 demons punish the soul for eleven years.

Then the soul is taken to rivers of fire and boiling pitch, filled with pig-faced demons who torment it for another eleven years.

Finally, it is cast into the outer darkness, where it remains until the final judgment. At that time, it will be dissolved and destroyed.”

Thomas asked, “We’ve heard of people who mix male seed and female menstrual blood into a kind of stew, saying they do this in the name of Esau and Jacob. Is this acceptable?”

Jesus, deeply grieved, responded: “Amen, I tell you, this sin is worse than all others. Those who do this will be cast immediately into the outer darkness, with no chance of return. There they will be destroyed in a place without mercy, without light—only weeping and grinding of teeth. All who are sent there are lost.”

Then John asked, “What about a person who lived a righteous life—doing good—but never received the sacred mysteries that allow the soul to pass through the rulers after death?”

Jesus answered:

When their time on earth is complete, the servants of Bainchōōōch (a being of the triple-powered gods) come for their soul. With joy, they travel for three days, teaching the soul about the creation of the world.

Next, they take the soul to the underworld (Amente) and show it the instruments of punishment—but it is not harmed, only lightly touched by the smoke of the flames.

Then they bring it to the “way of the midst,” where again it is gently exposed to the trials of those regions.

At last, it comes before the Virgin of Light, who judges it and entrusts it to the care of Sabaōth the Good, a guardian of the Midst, until the time is right.

When the sphere turns again—symbolized by the movements of Zeus, Aphrodite, Kronos, and Ares—the Virgin gives the soul to her receivers. They take it to the waters beneath the cosmos, where it is purified in a seething fire.

After this, Yaluham gives the soul the cup of forgetfulness. It forgets all it has seen and experienced.

Then a receiver from Sabaōth the Good brings a second cup—this one filled with wisdom and sobriety. The soul drinks and is born into a body that cannot sleep or forget, a body that continually longs for and seeks out the mysteries of the Light.

This longing, given by divine grace, will eventually guide the soul home.

### What it means

This chapter weaves together stark warnings with profound mercy. On the surface, it deals with severe judgments—especially toward those engaged in taboo or blasphemous behaviors, or those who manipulate sacred forces in distorted ways. While the language reflects the worldview and moral constructs of its time, the deeper truth is this: when we act in ways that defile or disrespect the sacred, whether in body, word, or ritual, we separate ourselves from the Light.

Yet, even more central is the fate of the righteous uninitiated soul—someone who has lived with kindness and goodness but never encountered the mysteries of spiritual awakening. This soul is not condemned. Instead, it is gently guided, taught, protected, and eventually gifted with a divine restlessness—a sacred longing that compels it to seek the Light across lifetimes.

This chapter reminds us that no outer label—initiate, believer, sinner, or righteous—defines our true standing before the Divine. What matters is the orientation of the heart and the willingness to seek truth, even when we’ve forgotten where to begin.

### Reflection

* Where have you dishonored or misunderstood what is sacred—within yourself or others?
* Are you willing to let divine restlessness awaken in you a desire to seek truth more deeply?
* How do you hold the tension between divine justice and divine mercy—both in others and in yourself?
