## Postscript — The Apostles Proclaim the Light

After receiving the mysteries and the teachings of the Light, the apostles went out into the world. They traveled in groups of three, going to the four directions of heaven—north, south, east, and west.

Everywhere they went, they shared the goodness of the Kingdom of God. And Christ worked through them—not just in words, but in signs and wonders that confirmed the truth of their message. Through their actions, the presence of God’s Kingdom became known throughout the earth, shining even into the whole world of Israel, serving as a witness to all nations—from the rising of the sun to its setting.

Thus the Light spread.

### What it means

The final note of Pistis Sophia is not a new revelation but a quiet, powerful echo of a commission: go and embody the Light. The apostles, having received the inner mysteries and been transformed by them, didn’t stay in contemplation—they went out.

They went out in threes—symbolizing spiritual strength, companionship, and the divine pattern of unity, diversity, and wholeness. They didn’t go empty-handed. They carried within them the mystery of the Light, and the Christ—now within—acted through them with power. Their words were not just talk. Their lives became evidence.

The message is simple but world-changing: When we awaken to divine reality, we are not meant to keep it hidden. We are meant to become it. Not just in speech, but in presence, in healing, in witness.

This is not the end of the story. It is the passing of the flame—from Christ to his apostles, and now, to us.

### Reflection

* How might you embody the Light, not just believe in it?
* Who are the “three” you travel with—those you walk with in spirit and truth?
* Where are you being called to shine light—through action, presence, or healing?
