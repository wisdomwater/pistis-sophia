## Chapter 148 — Mercy for the Sinner and the Stars That Guide Us

Mary asked, “If someone has committed every kind of sin and never discovered the mysteries of the Light, will they suffer punishment for each sin individually?”

Jesus answered, “Yes. If they’ve committed three sins, they’ll be punished for all three.”

John then asked, “But what about someone who has committed every kind of sin—but in the end discovers the mysteries of the Light? Can they still be saved?”

Jesus said, “Yes. If that person finds the mysteries, lives them out, fulfills their purpose, and no longer continues in sin, they will inherit the Treasury of the Light.”

Then Jesus spoke again to his disciples:

“When the cosmic sphere turns, and the planets Kronos and Ares pass behind the Virgin of Light, while Zeus and Aphrodite pass in front of her—in that moment, her veils part, and she rejoices to see those two stars of light.

In that joyful hour, every soul she sends into the world will be righteous and good. These souls will seek and find the mysteries of the Light.

But if the order is reversed—Ares and Kronos before her and Zeus and Aphrodite behind her—then she cannot see the light. And in that darkened hour, the souls she casts into the world will be troubled, angry, and unable to find the mysteries.”

Hearing all this, the disciples wept and cried out:

“Woe to the sinners! Woe to those who suffer because of the forgetfulness and negligence of the rulers, who trap them until they die and are led to judgment. Have mercy on us, O Son of the Holy One. We, too, have sinned. Save us from these punishments and these terrible judgments!”

### What it means

This chapter is a powerful window into both the gravity of our actions and the endless mercy available to us. It confirms a sobering truth: we are held accountable for our choices. But it also offers extraordinary hope—even those who have done everything wrong can be redeemed if they awaken to the Light and change their path.

The second half of the teaching introduces a cosmic dimension to human birth and destiny. The Virgin of Light acts as a gatekeeper of souls, and depending on the astrological alignment of the planets, she either sends souls into the world filled with divine longing, or allows them to be born into confusion and wrath. While symbolic, this reveals a deep spiritual truth: not all are born with the same clarity, the same access to Light, or the same inner compass—but grace is always possible.

Even the disciples, aware of their own shortcomings, cry out for mercy. Their plea is not just fear—it is humility. It is the heart recognizing its dependence on something greater, something holy.

In a world that can feel indifferent to justice or overwhelmed by shame, this chapter reminds us: No matter how lost you are, if you turn toward the Light and stay on the path, you can still come home.

### Reflection

* Have I ever believed my past disqualified me from spiritual awakening?
* What inner “alignment” or condition helps me become more open to divine Light?
* Do I, like the disciples, allow myself to grieve my failings while still trusting in mercy?
