## Chapter 146 — The Fates of the Thief, the Arrogant, and the Blasphemer

Peter, frustrated by how often the women are speaking, says to Jesus,  
“Master, let the women stop asking questions so that we men may also speak.”

Jesus gently replies, “Allow your brothers to have their turn.”

Peter then asks: “What happens to a thief who persistently steals throughout their life, once they die?”

Jesus responds:

If such a soul reaches the end of its time on earth, the servants of Adonis come to guide it. For three days, they travel through the world, showing the soul the nature of creation.

Then the soul is taken before Ariel in the underworld and punished for three months, eight days, and two hours.

Next, it’s brought before Yaldabaoth and his 49 demons in the realm of chaos, where each demon takes its turn punishing the soul for the same amount of time.

After that, the soul is led through the “way of the midst,” and each ruler there inflicts further torment through dark smoke and fierce fire.

Eventually, the soul arrives at the Virgin of Light, who judges both the righteous and the sinful. When the great cosmic cycle turns, she hands the soul over to her servants, who cast it into the lower realms, where it is purified by a seething fire.

Finally, Yaluham, the servant of Sabaoth the Adamas, gives the soul the cup of forgetfulness. After drinking, it forgets all it has experienced and is placed into a new body—one that is lame, blind, and broken.

This is the fate of the thief.

Then Andrew asks, “What happens to an arrogant man?”

Jesus answers:

When his time is complete, the servants of Ariel come and escort the soul, spending three days revealing the nature of the world.

It is then brought before Ariel for twenty months of punishment.

Then it is taken to Yaldabaoth and his demons, who punish the soul again for twenty months.

Next, it travels through the “way of the midst,” where the rulers each inflict torment for another twenty months.

Afterward, the soul is brought before the Virgin of Light for judgment. When the cosmic cycle turns, she sends the soul to the spheres where it is immersed in purifying fire.

Finally, the soul drinks the cup of forgetfulness from Yaluham and is reborn into a body that is deformed and despised by others.

This is the punishment of the arrogant.

Then Thomas asks, “What about someone who constantly blasphemes?”

Jesus replies:

When such a soul dies, Yaldabaoth’s servants come and bind its tongue to a horse-faced demon. For three days, it is dragged through the world and tormented.

Then it is sent to the cold, snowy regions for eleven years of suffering.

After that, it is brought before Yaldabaoth and his 49 demons for another eleven years of torment.

Lastly, it is cast into the outer darkness, where it remains frozen and dissolved—until the final judgment of the great dragon-faced ruler.

This is the judgment of the blasphemer.

### What it means

This chapter uses vivid imagery to describe the soul’s journey after death, especially for those bound to theft, arrogance, or blasphemy. While the punishments may seem harsh or mythological, they are deeply symbolic and point to the inner consequences of spiritual distortion.

The *thief* represents the part of us that takes from life—energy, attention, or material—without offering gratitude or reciprocity. Rebirth into a body that is lame and blind reflects how this soul has cut itself off from true spiritual vision and movement.

The *arrogant soul*, obsessed with pride and superiority, becomes despised by others in its next life. This shows how arrogance isolates us from genuine connection and leaves us spiritually malformed.

The *blasphemer*, who desecrates or mocks what is sacred, is bound by the very force he mocked and left in freezing darkness—an image of total disconnection from the warmth and Light of the Divine.

Each of these examples offers us a mirror: not to judge others, but to examine the tendencies in ourselves that rob, boast, or reject the sacred. In this way, these mythic punishments serve not to condemn but to call us toward awareness, humility, and reverence.

### Reflection

* Where in my life do I take without giving, or close myself to trust and generosity?
* Do I harbor arrogance or pride that isolates me from others or from truth?
* Have I disregarded or disrespected what is sacred within me or in others—and how can I return to reverence?
