## Chapter 145 – The Chastisement of the Murderer

Mary, overwhelmed by what she had just heard, cried out, “Woe, woe, to sinners!”

Then Salome asked Jesus, “My Lord, what happens to the soul of someone who has done nothing wrong except commit murder?”

Jesus replied: “If such a person’s time on Earth is complete and they leave the body, the agents of Yaldabaōth come. They tie the soul by its feet to a great demon with a horse’s face and circle the earth with it for three days.

After that, the soul is taken to the freezing regions of snow and cold, where it suffers for three years and six months.

Then it is brought to the realm of Yaldabaōth and his 49 demons. Each demon beats the soul with fiery whips for another three years and six months.

After this, the soul is sent to Persephonē in the underworld, where she punishes it further for three years and six months.

Then, the soul is carried through the “way of the midst,” and each of the rulers there inflicts their own form of torment—again for three years and six months.

Finally, the soul is taken before the Virgin of Light, who judges all souls. When the great cosmic cycle turns, she commands that the soul be cast into the outer darkness, where it will remain until the “darkness of the midst” is lifted. At that time, the soul will be utterly destroyed and dissolved.

This, Jesus said, is the final punishment of the murderer.

### What it means

This chapter presents a deeply symbolic portrayal of the destructive consequences of murder—not just in terms of a single act, but as a profound severing of the soul from the Light.

Murder, in this vision, is not simply physical violence; it is the ultimate violation of sacred life. The punishment imagery—cold wastelands, demonic torments, and cosmic judgment—reflects the immense karmic weight and spiritual fragmentation that such an act creates.

Being bound to a beast and dragged through regions of suffering represents the soul’s inability to find rest. It is trapped in cycles of pain, alienation, and disintegration. Unlike the sins that are eventually purified and reborn, this soul faces dissolution—suggesting a complete loss of divine connection.

Yet even here, we must read these images through the lens of spiritual psychology. The “murderer” might also symbolize any force within us that seeks to destroy what is vulnerable, sacred, or alive—whether in ourselves or others. To “kill” joy, hope, love, or truth through bitterness, control, or hate is to walk the same inward path of destruction.

### Reflection

* Are there parts of myself or others I have wounded or “cut off” out of fear, pride, or pain?
* What does it mean to honor the sacredness of life—not just biologically, but spiritually?
* How can I turn toward healing and reconnection, even with the darkest parts of my past?
