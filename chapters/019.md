## Chapter 19 — Mary Is Blessed and Invited to Ask More

After Mary finishes her interpretation, Jesus praises her:
“Well spoken, Mary. You are truly blessed among all women on the earth. You will become the fullness of all that is full, the perfection of all that is perfect.”

Mary rejoices at this blessing. She comes before Jesus, kneels at his feet in reverence, and says:
“My Lord, please allow me to ask you something more about what you said, before you begin speaking to us about the places you went.”

Jesus responds with kindness and openness:
“Speak freely, Mary, and don’t be afraid. I will reveal everything you ask about.”

### Reflection

* What does it mean to be "the fullness of all fulnesses" or "the perfection of all perfections"?
* How do you relate to Mary’s role as one who seeks and speaks spiritual truth?
* Are there questions you carry that you’ve been afraid to ask?
