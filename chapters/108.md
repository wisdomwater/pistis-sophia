## Chapter 108 — Helping the Dead Through Love and Divine Intercession

When Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene bowed down, kissed his feet, and said:

“My Lord, please be patient with me if I ask you another question. Don’t be angry.”

Jesus replied:

“Ask whatever you want, Mary. I will reveal everything to you clearly and openly.”

So Mary asked:

“Lord, imagine a good and faithful brother—someone we have already filled with all the mysteries of the Light. Now suppose he has a brother, or relative, or someone close to him—whether a sinner or just someone who wasn’t yet awakened—and that person has died. And now the good brother is heartbroken, grieving for this person, worried that he is suffering punishment or harsh judgment in the afterlife. What can we do to help that soul be freed from judgment and pain?”

Jesus replied:

“I’ve spoken about this before, but I’ll say it again, so you may be complete in all understanding and be called ‘perfected in every fullness.’

If you want to help someone—whether they were a sinner or not—not just to be released from judgment, but to be reborn into a body that will seek and find the Divine Mysteries and rise into the Light-kingdom, then here is what you must do:

Perform the third mystery of the Ineffable, and say the following prayer:

‘Take the soul of this person we hold in our hearts. Free them from all punishments and harsh judgments. Bring them quickly before the Virgin of Light. And each month, may the Virgin of Light place a higher seal upon them, and each month, may she place them into a righteous body—one that will seek the truth and ascend into the Light-kingdom.’

If you say this prayer with the third mystery, truly, I tell you: All the cosmic beings involved in judgment will release that soul. They’ll pass it along from one to the next until it reaches the Virgin of Light.

She will seal it with the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable and hand it over to her angelic receivers. They will then place that soul into a new body—one that is righteous and ready to seek the mysteries of the Light. And from there, that soul can rise and inherit the Light-kingdom.

This is the answer to your question.”

### What It Means

This chapter offers one of the most tender and powerful teachings in the Pistis Sophia: our prayers and love can help free souls who have already died.

Mary brings a deeply human concern: What if someone I love has died in ignorance or sin? What if they’re suffering now? Is there anything I can do for them?

And Jesus says: Yes. Through the power of the third mystery of the Ineffable—the highest realm of compassion and mercy—you can intercede for them. If your heart holds them in love, and you perform the sacred work with sincerity, the forces of judgment will let that soul go, and it will be passed upward toward healing and renewal.

This is not just a spiritual transaction. It’s a recognition that divine love is stronger than death. We are not powerless in the face of a loved one’s karma or fate. If we act from compassion, with spiritual intention, we can literally change the trajectory of a soul.

The process culminates with the Virgin of Light, a symbol of purity and grace, who seals the soul and ensures it is reborn into a life where it will have a new chance—to grow, awaken, and return to the Light.

This chapter invites us into a larger view of love and responsibility. Death is not the end—and neither is our connection to those we love.

### Reflection

* Have you ever mourned someone and worried about their spiritual well-being after death?
* What does this teaching suggest about the power of prayer or intention for others—even those who have died?
* How might it change your view of karma or judgment to think that mercy and love can override them?
