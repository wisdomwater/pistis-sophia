## Chapter 103 — Why Even the Righteous Need the Mysteries

After Jesus finished speaking, Mary Magdalene stepped forward and asked:

“My Lord, what about someone who is truly righteous—who has lived without any sin at all? If such a person dies without ever receiving the mysteries of the Light, will they still suffer punishment? Or will they be brought straight into the Kingdom of Heaven?”

Jesus answered her:

“A truly righteous person—one who has lived without sin but never received the mysteries—will still face a kind of journey after death.

When they die, spiritual beings from the great triple-powered realm will come to protect their soul. These beings will rescue the soul from harsher forces that would normally punish the uninitiated, and they’ll spend three days circling it through the energies of all creation.

After that, they bring the soul down into the chaos—not to condemn it, but to let it pass through certain judgments. The soul will feel some discomfort from the fires of chaos, but not much, and only for a short time.

These helpers will then have compassion and lift the soul upward again, past the lower rulers. These rulers won’t inflict harsh punishments, though their regions might trouble the soul a little.

If the soul reaches the domain of Yachthanabas—a particularly unkind ruler—it still won’t be judged harshly, but it may be detained for a short while and mildly affected by the energy there.

Eventually, the helpers raise the soul further and bring it to the Virgin of Light. She examines the soul and sees that it is pure—free from sin. But because the soul lacks the sign of the mysteries (the spiritual initiation), she will not allow it to enter the Kingdom of Light.

Instead, she gives the soul a higher seal and sends it back into a body in a righteous realm—a place where it will have a good chance of receiving the mysteries in its next life and entering the Light forever.

Now, if that righteous person had sinned once or twice or three times, they would be sent back into a new life according to the nature of their sins—a process I’ll explain later when I describe the universe more fully.

But listen carefully: Even if a person has never sinned at all, they still cannot enter the Light-kingdom unless they’ve received the mysteries. It is simply not possible for any soul to reach the Light without them.”

### What it means

This chapter challenges a common assumption—that being a “good person” is enough for spiritual liberation.

Mary’s question is a powerful one: *Isn’t it enough to live a sinless life?*

But Jesus’ answer shifts the focus. Righteousness is good, but it's not the same as spiritual transformation. The mysteries (which can be seen as inner knowledge, spiritual awakening, or divine initiation) are what open the way to the Kingdom of Light. Without them, even the purest soul cannot fully ascend.

Still, there's compassion in this teaching. A righteous soul is not condemned but guided through a gentler version of the after-death journey. It suffers only slightly and is eventually reborn into favorable conditions—so it has a real chance to receive the mysteries in a future life.

The deeper message: *Goodness prepares the ground, but divine initiation awakens the seed*.

### Reflection

* Do you believe being “good” is enough for spiritual enlightenment? Why or why not?
* How do you understand “the mysteries of the Light”? Are they rituals, revelations, inner experiences?
* Does this teaching challenge your view of life after death, or how spiritual growth works?
