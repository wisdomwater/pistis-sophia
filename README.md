# Pistis Sophia: A Devotional Reimagining

This project is a modern, devotional interpretation of the ancient Gnostic text *Pistis Sophia*. It seeks to bring the profound spiritual journey of Sophia—the soul's descent into chaos and her redemption through divine light—into language and imagery accessible to the 21st-century seeker.

## Purpose

The *Pistis Sophia* is a rich but often obscure text, filled with symbolic cosmology and archaic phrasing. This project offers:

- **Modern Language**: Simplified, clear, and poetic rewordings of each chapter.
- **Devotional Tone**: A focus on the soul’s relationship with Divine Light, compassion, and spiritual awakening.
- **Contemplative Structure**: Chapters are reframed for reflection, meditation, and personal transformation.

It is not a scholarly translation, but a spiritual companion—offered as a devotional retelling rather than a doctrinal statement.

## Who This Is For

- Seekers disillusioned with institutional religion but hungry for inner gnosis.
- Readers of mystical and esoteric texts who desire a heart-centered, soul-anchored perspective.
- Those looking to integrate the mythic story of Sophia into their own spiritual path.

## Format

Each chapter from G.R.S. Mead’s translation of *Pistis Sophia* is reinterpreted with:
- A retelling of the text in modern, accessible language
- A commentary of what the passage means to one's spiritual journey
- Reflections or guiding questions
