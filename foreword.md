# Foreword

Welcome, dear reader, to a journey of the heart—a gentle invitation to walk alongside the soul of Sophia as she seeks, stumbles, and rises toward the Divine Light. This book, *Pistis Sophia: A Modern Retelling and Devotional Guide*, is born from a longing to make ancient wisdom accessible, warm, and alive for the modern seeker.

The original *Pistis Sophia* is a text of mystery and depth, its language often veiled and its symbols vast. Here, you will find its spirit lovingly reinterpreted: each chapter offered in clear, poetic language, with a devotional tone that centers on compassion, awakening, and the soul’s relationship with the Light. This is not a scholarly translation, but a spiritual companion—crafted for reflection, meditation, and transformation.

If you have ever felt disillusioned by institutions yet yearned for inner gnosis, or if you are drawn to the mystical and the mythic, this book is for you. May you find in these pages a heart-centered perspective, a soul-anchored path, and a gentle guide for your own spiritual journey.

Let this work be a lantern for your path, illuminating the hidden Light within you. May Sophia’s story inspire you to trust your own descent and ascent, to embrace both your questions and your longing, and to remember that the Divine Light is always seeking you, even as you seek It.

With warmth and blessing,

Michael
